I don't like vendors who come here new asking for FE & have conditions & can't differentiate between an old buyer with a perfect purchase state & a clean reputation & a new one ..... Lucydrop didn't even bother to reply to my last PM even though he read it  .....

Once site has launched we will browse around see what LSD vendors come on and begin updating this thread as the testing roles in. Of course we will give the site a little time to get it's feet under it and we recommend all users to be cautious! As many may have learned from the Project Black Flag incident  it is unwise to go blindly trusting into things even if they look so promising. Always encrypt addresses and important information! Stay safe and secure be smart. To those who have been on the streets for their goods before you should be as pr-cautious as you were then now as well on all sites it is no different because it's online. Of course to those who never been on the streets we advise you to follow all methods of encryption and protection for yourself there are many illegal substances being purchased and you shouldn't need to be reminded that it is possible to be caught and arrested for such a thing.

It never was the glory of its prior self and now it appears it might never be. While we very much appreciate the ground that the Silk Road has paved for use we are sadly exploring serious alternatives.There is a very real possibility that we will be presenting a new system of vending at our backup url: http://sapphiremdvviknb.onion/Please save this URL and my PGP key at the bottom of this messageThere is nothing at this url now howiever if we decide to go this route(which now seem likely) then it may take 1 or 2 months to become operational sooner if the muses are in our favor.Our new marketplace will be different than what you are used to. It will not have a 3rd party escrow service this has been demonstrated to be too much of a liability. Rather we will adopt a federated peer-to-peer method of business that is based on trust and respect. It will have a lower attack profile and as such limit communication this will be an inconvenience but will drastically increase security.It is my strong belief that the fundementals that the Silk Road is based on are sound. Tor PGP and bitcoin are secure. The fault lies in the centralization. With this in mind we will seek to deal directly with our customers in the safest possible fashion in the future.If your order was marked as shipped then it was if it was not marked as shipped then it is lost.

"9",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Hey Tess!  Great to see you back and I'm looking forward to ordering more of your amazing product.  Tessellated will always be special to me because the first thing I ever bought on Silk Road was a ten strip of Tessellated's amazing LSD.  In fact I only ordered twice off the old website before it was taken down and both times were from Tessellated and both times I purchased acid.  The first order was a ten strip and the second I purchased 25 hits.  I was excited about getting the 25 because they were a batch that were a little stronger!  I think Tessellated said that they accidentally laid more acid on the paper than anticipated and the hits were around 220-230 mics.  Too bad I just recently used my last hit out of that batch   I'm not the most expereienced tripper as I just started experimenting with psychadelics back in March but I can assure you that Tess's acid is incredibly potent and strong.  The first time I tripped back in March was on some really good shrooms.  I'll never forget that night.  The next two times I tripped was on some acid that we got from a buddy he knew.  The trips were fun but you can really tell more pure acid from dirtier acid and this acid just felt dirty.  It just wasn't that pure.  Me and my buddy were upset because we wanted better LSD but didn't know of anywhere to get some.  I've been a libertarian for a couple years and mentioned to my buddy that there were talks in libertarian circles about a website called Silk Road that you buy illegal drugs on and have them shipped to your house.  Of course this just sounded insane to me.  How was this even possible?!  Wasn't this dangerous?  I was curious so I looked up how to access the Silk Road.  I downloaded Tor found the URL registered and BAM!! There it was! The first time I accessed Silk Road it really blew my mind.  It was so surreal.  I started researching LSD vendors and how to order safely from Silk Road.  I researched for weeks.  I learned how to use Tor and PGP read up on tons of stuff on shipping.  I finally felt I was ready to make a purchase.  BTW a big shout out and a sincere thank you to the mods and members of this forum.  I've learned so much just by browsing the old and new Silk Road forums.  I'm proud to be part of this movement.  I had narrowed down my LSD vendors that I was considering buying from and eventually settled on Tessellated.  Tessellated had outstanding reviews and the best mics for the price.  I felt confident that this would work.  I got my bitcoins bought my first ten strip and encrypted my address and sent it to Tessellated.  Those 6 days I waited were incredibly long.  I was so paranoid.  I knew my chances of getting caught were low especially with LSD but you can never be to cautious or paranoid.  So 6 days later the acid came in the mail.  I looked at the envelope and knew what it was and what it's contents were.  I thought accessing Silk Road for the first time was mind blowing that was nothing to actually receiving the drugs I o rdered in the mail.  It literally blew my mind. Me and my friend opened the package together and were extremely impressed by the stealth.  There it was.  The acid I had ordered was right there in front of me.  It was almost no different than ordering something off amazon.  We ended up tripping that night.  We took one hit each and it was one of the best trips I've ever had.  It was incredibly euphoric.  I couldn't believe how PURE this LSD was.  Me and my buddy were again impressed.  It was a great trip.  We really bonded and the music was just blissful.  I really love how great LSD makes music.  LSD is really such a beautiful chemical.  The way it makes me feel the spirituality and bonding I get with my fellow friends while tripping makes me so thankful that my buddy introduced me to psychadelics.  Psychadelics have also helped me cope with some of the baggage that comes with being a veteran.  Me and my buddy ran out of those 10 hits a lot faster than we thought we would. LOL.  So we decided to order more.  Since I already trusted Tessellated I decided to order 25 this time instead of 10.  This transaction was just as flawless as the first.  I received the package in about 5 days and released the funds from escrow.  I was so happy to finally have a way to get pure and potent acid.  That was until the first Silk Road was taken down.  NOOOOO!!!! I was so pissed because right around the time SR got taken down I was planning on ordering more acid from Tessellated.  Now I've had to wait patiently but the opportunity has finally come.  I'm excited but also nervous ordering again because it has been so long.  I'm glad to see you back Tessellated and I look forward to many successful future transactions","psychedelics","878",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Expect reviews over the weekend and Monday.""Best Meth I've ever had I think. Other than my first few hits back in my younger days. I'll leave the full review on Monday"" This is what a reviewer had to say and he did tell me he was a heavy user. I have seen Meth being offered else where (Sheep) at ridiculously low prices for in the UK - I've ordered some to test out. At such a low price it doesn't seem right. If it is good clean crystal then I will be honest and let everyone know it is. I will even post the lab results. I am not one for damaging anyones business just because they can offer cheaper product than me I just want people to know the percentage of the product they are paying for as it seems the UK meth game may become like the Coke one. Everyone claiming they have the 90% stuff and charging a 100 a gÂ  when they actually don't. I want the meth market to be priced accordingly over here. I do not want people coming here with 50% pure product and charging 150 a gram for it and because most people haven't had good Meth thats just what they expect Meth to be like so they continue paying that.. That's ridiculous. I always have 80%+ product and will charge 100 gram when shop opens if it's popular price will drop. So other Meth vendors please don't try pull the wool over anyones eyes as I will post images of the lab results as well. This will all begin in December at some point. People may say that I am just saying this because they offer it cheaper than me. That is not the case. My quality and service speaks for itself so I am sure I'll build a happy loyal customer base. My Meth I have tested and it's always above 85% and I am lucky to have met the right person to set up the connect I needed to get this in to the country. It was really pure luck. I went to the states and bought Meth off several dealers and the purest one I asked the dealer to meet his supplier for a fee and so on until I found someone high enough in the chain that was getting it uncut from the source and he agreed to ship it to me and then I showed him how to ship the stuff properly with MBB's and so on. Â Anyone claiming 100% pure meth is lying. Heisenberg was cooking 99.2%. Nobody is Heisenberg. Peace and love","psychedelics","444",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"11",NA,"the l-team lsd vendors review ~~ look at op","Its  great to see silk road 2 and the forums resurrected aknew. This is a re-post with slight editing from one  I put up in the BMR forums but its more relevant here ................ I always enjoyed reading learning and planning my buying accordingly back on the  silk road mrk1 forums.I love my ‘sid’  and did a bit of buying of it on silk road mrk1 right up to the very  end and I thought I’d share my previous silk road acid experiences.The first sr trips I got were Myan Calendars’ brought from a domestic seller. They were great and a big step up from domestic  stuff brought from local ‘street’ dealers. The Myans were very clean and I got good visuals  and a decent long lasting trip.The next lucy I got were Avatars from a Aussie seller and these were good too but not as strong as the Myans. They were good ‘social acid’ and that’s the way I think of acid in the 90-130 range. It’s good for socializing dancing party’s  its good for having a laugh and acting silly.Under the influence of an Avatar I ordered some sugar cube grateful dead acid from AlbertHoffman43. This was rather silly of me from the point of view I would have been far wiser to order flat small blotter paper on a imported international order. The lesson is don’t place orders under the influence of drugs Uncle Alberts43’s stealth was up to the job though it came through customs in escape from colditz castle stylze  and I enjoyed his acid which I rated stronger than the avatars.Then in the final days of sr ( although we had no inkling ) I’d ordered from three different vendors  in my quest for the best sid.Tesselated’s trips arrived about 15 hours before the road went down I’d finalized as soon as I saw them so hopefully he/she got their coins out. Tess’s trips were the best and strongest I’d had from the road up to that point they were/are very good.And then 5 days after the road was closed Machine Maids orange sunshines turned up. I’m gutted I never got to Finalize my coins to Machine Maid because his/her trips were OUTSTANDING. My girlfriend was watching the ceiling ‘open up’ on a half and on a whole one  I was getting intense visuals with face’s melting pictures morphing and the bricks around this fire-place were breathing.I’d hoped Machine Maid would re-appear as a vendor because I’d offer to go halves’ in their loss on my order. I got 100% of what I ordered and they missed out 100% on my money even though I had paid it . But if they do reappear  I will  send them half the money that I paid the first time. That way we would both go 50/50 on what  FBI cost him on my order.  Why should he take all the loss when he sent me such stellar acid ?. My experience with the acid vendors I have used has been very positive and they have all been honest decent straight up people and a credit to themselves.LSD Vendors Review thread help guide buyers to these people","psychedelics","529",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

So let me start off with....Stealth: Stealth was absolutely fantastic. In fact it was so good my missus came in and handed me the package asking what sport supplements I had gotten  Very discreet packaging with a printed labelbusiness stickers and even a letter thanking me for my purchase. If this is only his regular stealth I can't imagine how good his super stealth is. 10/10Delivery: Packaged was shipped in the afternoon and was at my door the next morning. What more could you ask for? 10/10Product: Wow. Just wow. Myself and my mate just blazed up about 50mg of the sample and we are absolutely buzzing. Lovely clean hit. So much energy i dunno what to do with myself. I have had some strong stuff in the past but this stuff beats it hands down. 50mg between 2 people is not very much but that is all you need. Just about to hit the pipe again probably won't be able to finish the review I'll be so fucked  10/10I can honestly say Hiniguel is an excellent vendor with excellent product to boot. I have had a lot of communication with him over the last couple of weeks and he is a stand up gentleman.

It totally rocked my world in such a profound way - I know this sounds crazy but I almost feel like LSD got my life back. I am not the same for sureno. I am happier everything is more real I ""feel"" things on a deeper level and when I walk outside I just cannot help be be overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of this world. LSD is truly the greatest thing that has happened in my life because of the changes it has brought about in me on a spiritual level.    So it is no surprise that I have a deep connection to Tessellated and SR as they are a link tothe single most dominant event in my spiritual awakening.  When SR was shut down I wept deep tearsbut knew deep down that nothing was going to stop those who want freedom. I'm looking forward to going down that rabbit hole again Tess!","psychedelics","212",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"15",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Been wanting to post a review for some time but forgot my pass to my other account (sigh). I ordered from tessellated a couple of times on the original SR and of all the vendors I've had the pleasure of dealing with his service was of the most if not the most astounding... and deserves honourable mention. The first time I ordered from Tess was when they first started vending on the road.. and they were selling a typical printed blotter...can't recall the name....and the second time I ordered it was his notorious WoW. I’m quite an experienced tripper having taken LSD close to 30 times mushrooms ~15 DMT 5 or 6 and other PEAs like 2cb and 2ci about ~10 times. I’m also experienced with MDMA and especially dissociatives like MXE and Ketamine. LSD is overall my favourite psychedelic.After sampling many different blotters including a few offered by different vendors on the road I would be lying if I didn’t admit that the product received from Tessellated has without a doubt offered me the most reliable dosing and consistently clean-feeling experiences. Things I consider not-clean feeling would mostly be gastric: ie. noticeably apparent stomach discomfort nausea gas and diarrhea/constipation. Now I must mention that while I've had a much higher frequency of these symptoms when I've taken different batches of acid I've also had some of my most mind-blowing and life-changing experiences from these other tabs regardless. So remember don't be a complete snob about L! It's still precious stuff lol!However the fact is that Tessellated simply offers high-quality assurance. This is something essentially important and not always present with many other vendors. The product is accurately dosed making it easy to gauge how much to take to attain a (somewhat) particular level of experience. With only a little bit of preparation on my part concerning diet and timing I've actually only ever had really clean experiences when I've taken tess's blotter (and I've taken a lot of it). I've been weary of dosing high with certain other blotters when I've tended to experience negative physical symptoms at only medium-intensity (Sitting constipated on the toilet in a level 4 trip sounds pretty unpleasant...sorry for that image..:p).Aside from stellar product Tess clearly describe their intention and detail their procedure within their profile in a very welcoming and straight-ahead way making it easy for new and longtime buyers.  When I dealt with tessellated both times i received near-instant responses to all PMs both prior and after ordering. I even received a confirmation that my order was being processed mere hours after sending my shipping details. This is a relatively simple thing for a vendor to do and it makes the situation 100% more lax for buyers. I received my package within the same week of ordering both times and the stealth was incredible...literally the best I've had of all the orders I've placed.As for the experiences I've had with both blotter I've ordered from Tess...they have all been...well....like LSD. Honestly never had any notable problems.... or anything physical creep on me and my bowels. I've taken tess's blotters before numerous concerts and at home with friends and for solo experiences. Oh and that's the other thing....my mates IRL have attested to the same great things I've already stated concerning his product. I remember one particular show that my buddy and I attended outdoors. It had been a couple months since either of us had tripped and we took one tab each (~200ug). Now I should mention that I always have this thing where I think I won't get ""high"" enough when I trip on anything....like it'll be too much of a breeze and not very immersive....usually by 15 hours i'll think I'm at the pinnacle of the experience and the intensity of a full on LSD trip appears unfathomable (dumb i know)....as was not the case! Walking back from the show we couldn't figure out how to get to the pedestrian walkway of a bridge in our city....it was hilarious. We were just standing there in a parking lot staring....this monolithic bridge extending before us....trying desperately to tap into previous memories from weeks before of walking across always ending up in the same confused state after considering all options....and then bursting out in laughter at how ridiculous this simple situation was. This is one of my best comical memories of taking LSD. Now this goofy situation is nowhere near the level of significance of the more earth-shattering moments I've had on this blotter. But I'm sure you know what that kinda stuff is like if you've experienced at least 1/100000th of what this molecule is capable of. Tess's tabs offer a full experience after taking only 1 small blotter....very economical (But fuck economics...it's the experience man)  Wow I feel like a salesman for christ's sake. Honestly though it's difficult to think of anything negative...it's clear that Tessellated really gives a shit about doing well...everything is really well thought out. And they keep everything really simple that's the biggest aspect to their service that deserves praise. On the original SR there were plenty of excellent vendors selling LSD but in a lot of cases the quality assurance wasn't near as complete. Finally the price is excellent. All these things coupled with the assured quality of product and service makes Tess an obvious choice for amazing L....like I said there were and likely are other fantastic vendors with L but it's just so easy to throw your eggs into tess's basket when all of the necessary points of being a good vendor have been covered so affluently by both Tess and the resulting praise of the SR community. Its truly a blessing to be able to acquire such a fantastic thing in such paranoid times without having to sweat quite as much about it ya know?So.... that is my book chronicling how to properly utilise sales tactics. But actually I wanted to post all this stuff for some time to encourage those considering taking the plunge for L on SR to do it properly and hopefully get the most out of it. This an example of a very good vendor so keep that shit in mind when looking over SR and other marketplaces...there's a lot of bs out there and I've experienced it. Thanks for reading.... and especially... Thanks Tessellated! You and your product have honestly been the catalyst for me to make many positive changes in my life and this is undeniably of the utmost importance to me. I really appreciate the hell out of what you're doing....Thank you so much.Peace everybody.","psychedelics","1100",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"16",NA,"**hiniguel uk review thread** pure meth peruvian cola - bulk dutch mdma +  lsd!","First off i'd like to apologize to Hiniguel for the time it took for me to post this. Now down to the review.-Stealth-  10/10 Just like with the sample of MDMA the packaging was flawless there's honestly nothing negative i could say about it. I've ordered quite a lot of drugs off the old silkroad and the packaging was never as flawless as the one that Hiniguel provides. I wish i could provide more about the packaging but i have found no flaws with it but take my word for it when you order from Hiniguel your package will never be seized. -Communication- 10/10Communication hasn't really changed it's still perfect. If anything I've noticed that Hiniguel replies even quicker now! Which is quite a feat. Hiniguel is one of the best (if not the best) vendors i have ever come across a total stand up guy. Which I've found is rare with harder drug sellers definitely better than the tweaked out violent dealers that i usually come across. You can tell that Hiniguel cares about his customers.-Product- 10/10Being experienced with meth and stimulants in general and with a large tolerance I've come to accept that I'll never achieve a meth high like my first time but now my friends. that acceptance is no longer there because Hiniguels meth is hands down the best meth I've ever had the pleasure of putting up my nose. I started off with 20mg lines just to see if everything was in order.  then i achieved a nice mellow clean buzz then i knew everything was in order and this was great meth so i dumped the bag out crushed up into powder and snorted half of the bag and wow 5minutes later i was in another world a world that I've only ever experienced my first few times (Although I'm nostalgic and my memory isn't the greatest thing in the world i do think the rush that i achieved from this meth was better then my first time.)   And the rush lasted around an hour which was  crazy. because when i rush on rare occasions I'm used to rushing for 20minutes and if I'm lucky 30. At that time i was in euphoric bliss everything was perfect and i felt an inner peace that i rarely feel. When the rush calmed down i turned on my playstation and decided to play a little grand theft auto i was playing extremely well which is rare for me because I'm total shit at that kind of thing my concentration level was off the chart and it felt like i was a kid with a new game for my atari the excitement that you only experience as a kid was there. After a few hours and a few small bumps later. i felt that i could take the world on i went into my living room where my buddy was watching storage wars with a blunt in his hand i was talking to him for hours and hours he was looking at me like i was a complete psycho because i was talking a million miles per hour words just flying out of my mouth without even thinking about it i felt like a genius. I found the confidence to get some stuff off my chest with my buddy explained everything and we ended up having a very deep and emotional chat i still feel pretty wonderful because of the stuff that this meth gave me the confidence to say usually i talk complete bullshit. but with this stuff my thoughts were clear clearer then they've ever been. Oh man if i was this focused as a kid maybe my grades would of been a little higher and my job would of came with a much higher pay check  For around 8hours more i was still buzzing feeling very good about myself. Then it wore off and i was expecting to go through a day of a hellish comedown. But i barely even had a comedown apart from not being able to sleep which is expected for just about every stimulant. But i had a good afterglow and i could eat perfectly fine. Then i popped a few Valiums and an hour later i fell asleep. (was writing the review then nearly complete. woke up with my charger out of the laptop and i lost everything. So i do apologize for the late review) Woke up and i felt perfectly fine. Could function normally and everything seemed good.It's crazy that i had no comedown this is really some killer meth. you'd think walter white himself cooked it. You'd be crazy not to get your ice from Hiniguel cheaper then just about any UK vendor and the quality is amazing. I will be coming back for more I'd be stupid not too. -Tl","dr- (shortened version)Every was perfect with Hiniguel perfect packaging perfecting communication and amazingly perfect and clean meth . ---------------------------------I really recommend Hiniguel as a vendor and he deserves recognition for his perfect vending ability! There's much more i could say but for the readers sake I'm keeping it as short as possible. D.F","psychedelics",858,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"18",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","A lot is an understatement. As I'm gearing up for a new order to try over Christmas I thought I'd come in and offer some info about my experiences.I first ordered from Tess back in January before he was laying his own tabs - it was kind of an orange-bluish print I don't remember what. It turned out to be a weaker batch and after confirming Tess re-shipped a bunch of the new WoW to me. I think this event speaks volumes to his professionalism: when a supplier fucked up he not only sorted out every client who had issues but also overhauled his whole process so that it wouldn't happen again. Moral of the story: Tess has your back.After that I have ordered 30 or 40 tabs altogether (gave out a lot of it I don't trip nearly often enough to eat all of that) and every experience has been strong clean and extremely consistent acid. With Tess' tabs I've chilled and enjoyed the sun on lazy Saturday afternoons danced at UV-lit underground psychedelic parties attended religious ceremonies aimlessly wandered around millennium-old European cities lost my mind in the middle of an overgrown island swam under moonlight in the Atlantic ocean and achievedd a unity of body and mind with my girlfriend.What I can say about this acid is that for its strength it is extremely clean and... positive? Compared to Dalai Lamas which admittedly are a bit stronger the body load is is very low and the mood euphoric and this is not just me - a lot of my friends commented that they felt more euphoric and clear on Tess' WoW than anything else they had. Right now I feel like I'm mirroring TheMollusk's post because I can get behind everything he said. As for strength I also think that one tab of Tess' stuff is ideal if you want a full trip a perfect adventure that lets you experience the world in new ways... Though if you want mind blowing explorations of inner self you probably want to up the dose.I cant say how glad I am to see Tess back. He has earned my trust the right way and I'll go to him first whenever I need some good clean L.","psychedelics","376",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I studied it closely. I got a message. Part of it was that LSD is truly a miracle molecule that will lift filters in the brainallowing information to come through. Those who are ready to be enlightened or are enlightened will be given perfect informationclear and meaningful. Others will get rubbish- they have to come back after more karma healing to be given the truth. Thensome can't handle the truth. Anyway my whole body was vibrating- my lips and hands all tingly and buzzing- very sexual. And I was getting all sorts of interesting audio effects...echoes delays warps...CLASSIC!!! so fuckin amazin man. Tess' acid might seem expensive but when you dose 2 of others stuffeven local that I've encountered- nothing compares. Consistently clean and strong - 2 tabs is guaranteed to give you a REAL acid experience.One tab is nice for me-but two is just right - every person is different. Enjoy!

"23",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","My friend my brother and myself have been staying over at my friend's house for well over a week. Halfway through this stay we came up with the idea to get shrooms. After all of our dealers fell short we decided it would be in our best interest to simply buy off the silk road. This is where we found Trip and his offer of vials of liquid mushrooms. We came together and figured a bunch of vials would be the best option for us. Trip was incredibly pleasant to deal with he was more than willing to send us extra gifts to improve the trip or take the extra steps to make sure we had the best trip possible. He's an absolute professional in every sense of the word. Any questions I had he answered quickly within the same day and with as much information included in his answer as possible. While overwhelming at first I discovered that simply reading everything gave me all the information I needed and answered almost all of my questions. It was an overall very pleasant buying experience.The package arrived mere minutes from five on Wednesday afternoon. It came to the door in an inconspicuous cardboard envelope the contents inside were all secure and had no damage. We were way too eager to open them. When we ordered the vials we had decided ten would be a sufficient amount three for each of us and one extra for whatever reason. Like any sensible people who had ordered drugs off the internet we decided that it was in our best interest to drink them all at once but not before we drank one and worried why we weren't feeling anything. This feeling was soon replaced with an amazing sense of a profound awe and wonder thought to have been lost long ago in our childhood years. Everything was colorful posters were melting I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried. We had been on the trip of our lives only to discover we had literally done nothing but sit in our chairs for 5-7 hours. Anything we tried to accomplish was thwarted by our more pressing desire to sit down and watch the wall bleed black goop seeping through every crack. We couldn't even manage to turn on netflix after constantly reminding ourselves and each other to put something on let alone make it down into the basement to scare ourselves we ended up standing in the bathroom for an hour and then going down for two minutes only to find it wasn't as cool as upstairs was. It was just more fun to let time fly and watch everything breathe. While I cannot comment on the potency of just one vial three led to an amazing night for all of us. Smoking weed only made the high more intense but we didn't really get around to that much we got too distracted by the trip we were already on.Would I recommend this product to anyone else? Absolutely in fact I plan on getting more for myself later on. Perhaps I'll even have five or so vials for myself and just let the colors of the world around me mix together. But if you're going to buy liquid mushrooms buy through Trip I guarantee you won't be let down.","psychedelics","556",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

From the picture you sent me it looks like 4-5 of them were damaged in transit. While I apologize for this I assure you that they still work. The reason they are sent in gelcaps vs candies or sugar cubes is that 10 gelcaps weighs under 1 gram so if the police intercept them you won't do a five year mandatory bid. I really kind of wish you would have contacted me first instead of acting like I scammed you. I am more than willing to remedy this situation as you see fit.

"29",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","I just got some tabs from Tess the other week after all the reviews I saw I had to try out his stuff.And I was lucky enough to be one of the people that won some free tabs  But that won't influence my review of Tess's tabs at all.Shipping was quick and stealth was 10/10. This is a review for only half a tab I will be doing a full tab in another week or so. I took half a tab at 4pm took about 45 mins to an hour to start kicking in I felt like I just wanted to lay down and relax in that hour or so. After an hour or so I went to my computer noticed colors start to change a bit and images started becoming 3d like..music started getting much more vivid and intense. It became very easy to isolate certain sounds to listen to and the soundstage just seemed incredibly large. Sound didn't come from the speakers anymore it was just all in front of me if that makes any sense. Colors started to be animated and when I went online to chekout pics I was wondering why there happened to be alot of ""painted"" type pictures instead of all the usual photographs...about a few minutes in I realized that the LSD was changing pictures into oil paintings that was def very cool since I've never ever had that happen before. I started busting out my colored pencils and started to draw and it was very fun to see how I could mix 5 colors together and just make scrambles and be able to instantly focus on whatever color layer i wanted to..Being sober it would look like a mess of circles and lines but I was amazed how I was able to just pick out the layers of colors seperate from each other with ease. At the peak of it all I had to take a piss and I would say a huge feeling of euphoria kicked in . As I'm pissing looking at the art in my bathroom I realized why LSD is illegal. The whole time I was on it I was happycreativeloving. Unlike all the times I hang out with friends drinking beer and people bitching about their jobswiveslifesetc..LSD just allowed me to be happy and just look at everything I love rather than worrying about everything in life. After I went downstairs to hang out with my family everyone had a very light shadow all around their faces I hung out with my bird and my brothers dog. No one could tell I was on LSD but I did try my hardest not to laugh my balls off for nothing since around people LSD puts me in an extremely happy and energetic mood. I don't know what it is but everything seems so funny.Near the end of it all I was with a friend and was telling him how the trip was and near the end of trips for some reason I do get sad. I always want to share this with family and more friends but I know I can't at least not right now.  The only negative I find with LSD is that it is always harder to go to sleep. I even tried smoking with a friend to help me go to sleep but that didn't even work. Overall I give Tess's stuff 10/10. Would I order more once I'm done? 100% yes. I can't wait to do a full tab and am still in a bit of shock to see how strong just half a tab was for me. Overall length of it was around 4-5 hours with the comedown being around another 5 hours.I def see why people love Tess's LSD. Next time I can't wait to try more creative things on it and creating some art.","psychedelics","646",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

My friend and I drank the stuff at about 10:30 a.m. and it was both our first times. The experience was hands-down one of the most amazing things I've ever experienced. The come up was fun and goofy but when we started to peak it was an intensly spiritual and introspective in the best way possible. Time seemed to slow and quicken at random. We had a pandora playlist playing that I don't even remember. I had no idea what to expect but I was not dissapointed. Strong visuals for almost 7 hours.

I just want to enjoy time with family and friendsetc. I told them how I had been suicidal and mushrooms turned my life around and LSD made me see everything in a totally different viewpoint.

Somethings def fucked up with you"" LOL I was SHOCKED to hear that from people. Here I was in front of friends that I haven't hung out with in 2 years thinking they would see how much happier I am now that I'm not a slave to productsetc..I even tried to explain to them how LSD worked and it was like a bunch of deer in headlights in the room. They told me they only want to see cool things and didn't want to think..That part with friends was dissapointing at this point if they won't respect or want to learn about psych's I don't ever think I could give them a tab of Tess's stuff in confidence. One of them even asked me if they could drive while taking a full tab!I'd love to spread the love for some of Tess's tabs but damn...I feel like I can't give it to irresponsible people.

"32",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","[/quote]Yeah it is crazy. We live in a culture that expects and encourages people to be wanton in a perpetual state of lust for contentment through material things. Life is portrayed to be a dangling carrot where only the ""elite"" can enjoy life and this can only be had via amassing large monetary wealth which is a gift for the lucky few or those who work hard enough. So since the American Dream is just that and everyone knows deep inside that it's all a big scam- then it's only normal to be a depressedbitchycomplacent individual who drown out their sorrows by getting fat on fast fooddrowning in alcoholand buying worthless crap to feel like they ""have stuff."" The real irony is the media...which is constantly dangling the carrot. Look at any media and you will see people with perfect teeth- smiling or laughing- obviously in a state of ecstasybliss- geeif you buy our crap- smoke this cig ( wtfright?! ) take this medication ( really?! your poison?! ) eat this foodetc then you can be like these happy people. Which is sheer bullshit! Because even if it wasn't  you can't go around being happy without getting ridiculed. It's all about that carrot. We are obsessed with this idea of being on the chase searching for blissand it must be unattainable. So all that media portraying people being happy is supposed to rouse you into a spending spree to get some sort of quickie feel good- but in no way are you supposed to really become or be happy. Then you are not playing the game! You are then no longer in prison!!! You are FREE!and you cannotcannot never  ever be free in America! If you are then...well we'll lock you up- can't have content people walking around making other people jealous or maybe even freeing them. So it is in complete contradiction and sheer heresy to be truly happy today...unless you are on drugs. If you are not on drugs and are happy then you are crazy a yoga practicing tree hugging hippie ( who must be on drugs! ) or a secret millionaire.  So then it just goes without saying that LSD just can never be legal and must be stopped at all costs. As then people might awaken and see why we are sad-  that we could appreciate the natural beauty that is our universe that the truth of happiness exists through the heart and soul through acts of giving by searching within- not through moneymaterial things and political power.    NicotinecaffeineAlcohol- They are all physically toxic. they keep us on extreme polarities of malaise with a false sense of wellness. Sure alcohol gives one a head and body buzz but is it a nice one? Not really. It puts one in a stupor and there is few thought provoking insights gained. It does not invigorate one with a thirst for life. It's not supposed to. It's supposed to turn you down help you forget your sad reality that you've been told to envision. Caffeine and nicotine just get us all wired up so we can't get a good nights rest. They slowly mess up your nervous system toxify your organsdamage your immune system- and who knows what else. But that's ok cuz you should be all pepped up for your morning race to your 9-11 job(s). You could do some yogic breath workeat fresh fruits and  veggies rub the soles of your feet with magnesium oil ( amazing for energy boost! )  take a cool shower bang out some pushups or jumping jacks- but doing these things are truly healthy and would transform you into a superhuman. Don't do it people! Stay depressed - and for the sake of being in denial to wallow in self pity and be forever ignorant- don't ever take LSD!!!

Within about an hour I was getting tons of breathing walls and colorful patters.  At that time i left the party for a while to go for a walk and to play with my dog which was so much fun.   My mind was running wild by this point and decided to go back to party and listen to some TOOL.  I simply put on some headphones and played my favorite song ""Pushit""  off the salival album and just layed down on couch with my eyes closed and watched all the AMAZING closed eye visuals. it was so intense it even brought out my emotions and had a tears running down my face by end of the song. afterwards I hungout with everyone watching my sister dance with her POI.WE all continued to feel the effects as the night went on.  About 1am it was starting to wear down a bit but still felt amazing. I was pretty much back to normal by about 3am so i took my usual benzos to help me sleep after tripping and crashed out for the night.  Woke up next day and felt like a million bucks. no ""Acid Hangover"" what so ever. To me these definetly seemed to be the stregenth that is advertised as i am someone who usually eat 2-4 hits for a trip like that. I cant wait to order more from this guy.  This is my first time writing a review so i hope it is informative to some of you.","psychedelics","410",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It arrived the day before the shutdown (I finalized that day and I hope you were able to withdraw before it went down!) and stealth was far better than any other vendors out there (LE wouldn't be able to find it even if they tore the whole damn thing apart). The tabs came exactly as described (its nice having unperforated blotter so you can cut your own sized tabs). This wasnt my first time buying from Tessellated (the first time I bought a ten strip and ate 4 at once. 800ug is no trip. 800ug is a fucking spiritual journey). From the 50 hits I sold 35 to friends and EVERY person said it was the best they ever had (not exaggerating). The other 15 hits I ate were spectacular (not all at once. That would be a spiritual Oddessey!). Each hit was evenly laid as described. If you are having doubts about ording from Tessellated well have no fears. He is extremely reliable has great shipping times and his 200ug tabs will round-house kick the bejesus out of your brain (in a good way of course  ).

Just dropping by to say we have mostly finished our big update on tested vendors and such if you drop by the page you can see much of the new testing results for vendors here on SR2. Still some orders on their way so there should be a few more updates over the next few days until the next big order update. Happy upcoming Holidays to all happy tripping. this  invited me to come to your thread for the big update?    So why is pimpit not on your list is it because he is not on SR yet? anyway it was just a question a simple response would suffice. Perhaps you may want to post on the OP no hard questions  or don't challenge us. This way we can all follow blindly.much love.","psychedelics","162",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"38",NA,"the l-team lsd vendors review ~~ look at op","Hello friend flyinghigh we have already tested pimpit long time ago and posted the tests on BMR. If you didn't take the time to find out that information it is not our fault. We have tested already know vendors to recheck them and assure that their quality service hasn't gone down due to the shutdown of SR and everything that has happened since. The purpose of our service is to test ALL acid vendors. Not just new ones. And we have many of the new vendors products still on the way as previously stated earlier today. You aren't required to view our thread if you don't appreciate our work you can test your own vendors for your own purposes. But for all the other people out there besides you we are fully testing every vendor as fast as we can. If testing takes awhile it is because we have been operating on two market places at once.. testing vendors who have shipping times that vary greately and tolerance between members that might skew results and we do this all out of OUR own pockets for everyone in the community for nothing in return... We go to great lengths to test thoroughly and in the most efficient ways we can. In other news Thank you JOR look forward to trying them out.","psychedelics","221",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In terms of of cocaine ive tried on SR1 LoydsBrothers Budworx C63amg Dispater and loads of others i've forgotten aboutCOMMUNICATIONI got in touch with Hiniguel straight away when i saw his free U.K sample and within a few hours we had chatted and he got my details then posted! So great comms and super fast getting the sample out!5 out of 5SHIPPING / DELIVERYI ordered the sample on Friday afternoon and was out in the post box a few hours later!  I was hoping the order would be next day as it was 1st class but with it being the weekend and Royail Mail slow this time of year it arrived on Monday which was still fast. So 2 days.The stealth of the packaging was outstanding and very professional! The packaging ment there was no scent and the cola was very safe and hidden. Outstanding again.5 out of 5QUALITY OF COCAINESo when i got the cocaine out of the packaging it looked beautiful. Glistening fishscale in small rocks with a small bit of powder. I weighed it and it was over weight so i was very pleased! I could tell instantly this was AAA grade blow.  I took it out and crushed it was fairly soft and easy to crush and it released that lovely cocaine smell we all love and know well. I decided to have a small line first.  It was very smooth on the way up with no burning at all. A slow warm europhic buzz crept through my body and i was very impressed! Ive tried a lot of cola in the past 10 or so years and this was one of the best. No edgy ampiness and just a general great feeling. I decided to try a bigger line and it hit me hard. Be careful with this stuff it goes along way and i learned small lines are the way to go. Now bear in mind i got this at lunch time and it lasted me till late at night that's how high quality it was. Although it was moreish i was never over tweaked and when it was finished i could relax in bed and was asleep in no time. Clear nose and all. This coke has a slight numbing effect on the gums and nose but not overwhelming like other cocaine which is cut with novacaine e.t.c. This stuff matches the vendors i mentioned previously and may even be better! That's how chuffed i was.5 out of 5I highly recommend this gear! Good work Hinguel!Overall - 5 out of 5","psychedelics","460",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This wasn't the first time I've done his product before but this time I took two tabs instead of one and let me tell you that was a whole new level. I could barely see for about an hour because of all the crazy visuals in front of me. I took a walk in a park with a friend (who was on DOM) and the trees were changing from green to red to orange and back again. Music sounded absolutely amazing more so than ever before. The euphoria was insane unlike anything I've had on any psychedelic before. I love the deep happiness that LSD brings because it isn't artificial or forced like many stimulants are it allows you to truly reflect on your life and see all that you have to be happy about which is in my opinion much more genuine and meaningful. I'm planning on taking two tabs and some of Tess' MDMA when more comes in I can't express how excited I am for that.

"42",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Okay so i was involved with mr viking on another marketplace that just shut down due to someone stealing money or whatever.  Anyway i placed my order order was sent put in escrow site shut down and then I recieved my order.  Which was 3 hits of the salvador dali print lsd.  It is  listed as 140 microgram hits. I obviously couldn't finalize my order.  Well I signed up for sr2 and saw mr vikings listings on here.  I sent him a message offering to repay half of the original cost because i got my product yet he didn't get paid and i felt he deserved to.  Anyway he declined saying that it was unnecessary because he knows the risk of being a drug dealer over the internet.  Anyway here is the review of his service.Speed:  was put in transit within 24 hours of order.  I believed i ordered it on a thursday evening sent out friday and received monday!  No delay on his part which i love.  I hate sitting waiting for your vendor to put an order in transit and they take their sweet ass time.  Honestly right after quality speed is my most important factor in choosing a vendor.Stealth: all i can say is DAMN! I have only seen this type of stealth one other time (ive done hundreds of orders through online markets and you know ive only really been ripped off once! different story... anyway...) and it was not nearly as good/professional.  Im obviously not going to give out details but it was very impressive.  In my opinion more than necessary but it shows how important safety is to him and that is bad ass.Ptoduct: Amazing!: Okay did it last night because we had the place i work at shut down today due to a change in management computer systems.  Anyway wont go into a full trip report but i am very experienced with psychedelics.  Done alot of them all.  Like mushrooms and mdma the most.  Okay i took the 3 hits at once around 6pm.  Started driving home after about 30 min it kicked in and i had a 15 minutes worth of driving and tripping (which im not really a fan of but i was in the country and it was beautiful dangerous though.)  So around 930 im in my peak of the experience.  this is where it got amazing!.              I can tell im really out there.  I would say this blotter is appropriately advertised as far as dosing.  Def stronger than the 100mic hits im used to.  Now ego death is one of my favorite experiences.  If im tripping by myself (which i prefer in social situations i would rather take mdma) my goal is always ego death.  Ego death or dissolution is a state of mind that is not dose specific with a dose of any psychedelic.  I prepared myself for an ego dissolution.  So Im not saying take three hits and you are there.  If i wanted i could have been around friends and still held it together (i dont mean act sober mind you! i was blasted!)  Anyway I went into my computer room and put on a mix of goa psytrance from the 90's.  I then smoked a bowl of sour deisel and turned the lights off.  The images i was seeing/experiencing is something that cannot be typed or put into words.  Describing the psychedelic experience is like describing love.  You can come close but to truly understand you have to experience it.  I then decided to smoke a stupid big bowl of dmt (In the dark still)  AND GOT REAL SILLY! I started mumbling weird words that my mouth was just making up and then i started talking to the ""dmt entitieselves angles God gods spirits or whatever they are.""  We were having a blast with the things they were showing me.  Anyway after that started to die down i realized i was stuck with a dissolved ego.  I sat there in the dark laughing about how meaningless everything i worry and stress about in life.  How stupid it is i worship material things so much.  I thought about how my daughter ex-wife and music are the only REAL things in my life.  Everything else is fake and unimportant.  I thanked God for this gift of life and all the amazing experiences ive been blessed with.  Anyway its about 1 in the morning now and i turn on the light and change the music from trance to some jack white (the dead weather.)  I start texting friends telling them i wish they were with me.  A couple called me and asked what i was doing I told them ""Im having a party at my house and its the time of my life!""  One guy asked who all was over there and I told him just me and the elves.  He laughed and got off the phone with me.  The other (who plays guitar for me in our band) talked to me for a while.  He has been going through alot of change in his life that has been hard so we discussed all that people and the things they do girlfriends/marriage just life in general for about 2 hours.  I felt alot closer to him after that.  Anyway started slowly coming down.  Smoked some weed then started to clean my messy ass house.  I don't know why i make a mess when tripping.  I drank a couple of sierra nevada torpedos (I love IPA'S!) around 7 in the morning put on Marley (ducumentary about bob marley not the dog movie) and was asleep by 8.  Woke up feeling fucking amazing!  Great lsd.  By the way.  Had a small taste to it.  Its obviously the ink on the blotter as it was not chemically bitter/metallic like stupid research chems.  It was def high quality cid!  All in all buy this guys acid.  It kicks ass and you really need to see this stealth!  Hes also has good communication if your into chatting with your vendor.  Perfect experience aside from him not getting his bread!  But he was as cool as can be about it which gives me more confidence in him and his service.BUY FROM BLUEVIKING  Im out","psychedelics","1046",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

So lets kick things off withStealthHiniguel has sent me a few things in the past and I can honestly say that he has the best stealth in this marketplace. Never in a million years would you think there was drugs inside. Shipping was a tiny bit slower than with other packages he has sent but Royal Mail have been just awful since it's privatisation. There is a reason Hiniguel has a thread stickied at the top of the shipping section it's because his packaging really is on another level. QualityI opened the package to find the most beautiful glowing cocaine I have seem for quite some time. You could smell the rawness of the cocaine instantly. Beautiful aroma. I couldn't wait to get some up my nose. I grabbed a card and put out a tin line the coke was so soft and fluffy. The line went up so smoothly. Within a minute or two I could feel it hit me. I felt amazing. It had been sometime since I have had cocaine this pure so I was just taking the tiniest of bumps. I started to take it in the evening and it lasted until around 4 in the morning. Ending up off my face raving it out at a party. Had the time of my life! I have tried quite a few different vendors on these market places and for me the best was always the Lloyds Brothers.

"44",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","Thank you everyone for the kind words.When speaking about crystal (xtal for short) people are speaking about the final purity grade of the LSD produced. To be more specific one would need get into which precursor and synth was used to make it. Ergocristine versus Tartate etc and which method. But the general accepted information is the purity grade of your crystal.For me I will not play around below Silver. I have had exactly one batch of good Lavender in the last five years and in general have chosen to stay away from it because of all the bad ones. Silver (sometimes also called Grey as the Crystal is a light grey) can be great (Swiss tends to be better than Dutch) and is in general one of the less body loaded LSD experiences due to itsÂ  relative purity.Occasionally I get my hands on some righteous rose from India which is simply divine.I am a bit crystal sensitive Amber simply torments my body I have not nor will I ever touch TJ or Champagne.As you climb the LSD ladder you become more apt to being told what crystal your L was laid with and where it came from.When speaking of laying techniques people are usually referring to how it was evapped and if it was ""laid evenly"" or if has hot and weak spots on the sheet. When speaking of laying liquid people are referring to the suspension liquid of choice. I need to edit my listings to mention they are currently alcohol based.

"45",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","I ordered from Tess a while ago. My package arrived within a week. The stealth was impeccable--though I admit I haven't bought that many items from the road it is clear that out of the vendors I've ordered from Tess has put the most effort into concealment.This review is for one tab which I took as a ""test run"" over the weekend. Alone and in a darkish room I noticed the first effects--a slight tingling sensation--about 20 minutes after dosing. The comeup steadily built and at about 70 minutes I was fully tripping. The visuals were pleasant: I saw geometric colorful patterns on the wall and fuzzy distortion of objects. At one point I saw a speck on the ceiling and was utterly convinced it was a giant spider about to attack me! But a little bit of calm reasoning brought me to my senses.I always find listening to music on LSD to be a mystical experience so I put on some Animal Collective during the peak. As anyone who's listened to music on LSD could tell you the experience is phenomenal. While listening to music my closed-eye visuals were vibrant and kaleidoscopic. My dose wasn't large enough to trigger 3D CEVs but the 2D visuals were nonetheless not disappointing. During this time I felt a grand unifying connection to the world and the cosmos.After my musical voyage I went for a walk through a city park. Trees looked majestic and I noticed details in the environment that I would have never seen while sober. While outside an overwhelming feeling of happiness flooded me. I felt childlike and suddenly had a peculiar urge to simply run. So even though I wasn't wearing my athletic footwear I ran. I highly recommend running while on acid--during and afterward I felt unbelievably energetic and cheerful.Â The entire trip lasted about 6 hours with a pleasant comedown. I was able to fall asleep 8 hours after dosing which surprised me as I usually have unbearable insomnia after an acid trip.I have to emphasize that the light body load was one of the most positive features of the trip. This is some of the cleanest acid I've taken. Usually my body gets a bit achy on acid--but not so on Tess's. The entire trip I felt comfortable and relaxed. Tess is not joking when he says his acid is ""potent & clean.""In short I can't recommend Tess's product enough and I'll soon be ordering more. I plan to take 2.5 of his tabs in a few weeks for a truly spiritual out-of-this world experience.","psychedelics","428",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"46",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","TessI'll (hopefully) be putting an order in for your LSD and your MDMA very soon.Some questions...1 - Can you give everyone an idea of what to experience on 1 2 3 4 etc tabs of your LSD? I've done 2 and the body buzz and visuals were decent but I did not get to the point of my hand disappearing in front of my face or anything. I remember seeing trees 'vibrating' lights in the night sky morphing faces etc but nothing earth-shattering.2 - What is an experience of your MDMA like? As you know most street mdma is cut with meth mda other adulterants and a lot of people expect this uppity buzz to go dance to etc. From what I read your MDMA (being the purity it is) is very euphoric mellow etc...but can you give us an understanding of what a trip on your MDMA alone is like? Also what dosages do you recommend for experienced rollers? We don't want headaches or anything like that so we want to know what is the limit to set. IE is there much difference from 100 to 120mg or 150mg to 200mg?3 - Combining your LSD and MDMA - First I plan on taking the LSD first and about an hour or two in taking the MDMA. When the MDMA kicks in what changes in visuals should one expect to see? What physical effects occur? I've combined 25i and MDMA and the MDMA come up was intensified greatly visuals just got even crazier (hard to make out faces) and colors became EXTREMELY vibrant. Being 25i has similar effects to LSD I am wondering what to expect when combining.","psychedelics","278",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Perforation is always nice but the artist paper and pencil gives it a kind of ""homemade"" feelCut one tab and tripped for 8 hours at least (wasn't really keeping track... haha). It didn't quiiiite feel like 2 tabs of the other acid I've tried but then again that acid could have been 110-120ug.Hourly summary:First 5 minutes: Crazy electric feel below my tongue I've never felt it that strongHour 1: Started feeling the anticipation after about 25 minutes felt like I've just dosed myself with PURE ENERGY!Hour 2: Onset in full swing I kept shuddering to loosen up. The energy tends to make me kinda tense but again I reacted more than with 2 tabs of my old stuff.Hours 3-4: Jittery as fuck. I noticed a considerable increase in my typing skill and WPM (lol). Kinda like I drank some craazy coffee.Hours 4-6: Visuals finally kicked in. I was in the city just in my room so the visuals weren't stellar (visuals are way stronger for me when I'm out camping or something my friends agree)Hours 6+: Nothing unusual to report...The only thing that bugged me was the absence of visuals. Usually I can look at my arm and see my skin moving and shifting around but this wasn't the case. Other than that a fantastic experience one I hope to repeat many times and share with friends.

So given that 1g of xtal is 10000 100ug doses or 100 sheets and one were to dip their thumb into a jar of xtal and then lick their thumb...like about how many doses are we talking about? Obviously this is variable based on pressure and overall thumb coverage but my gosh!!! The stories I'm hearing. Some of these guys were dosing 1000ug + daily even before they got printed.

Confused now.Oh and far as thumbprinting goes taken from a clearnet site:""...LSD has a saturation dose somewhere around 1.5mg. Taking more than that adds length.

So you'd trip like you were on about 15 hits for a long time...""""I played drop a hit at every streetlight and that soon became drop the 10 strip and a friend and I went through 180 hits between the two of us....it was just a long ass peak but it was intense....but you can only trip so hard and you often get to that peak with a 10 strip....anything more is a waste and really just makes it last longer....I stopped trippin after about 36 hrs and slept for 2 days after...but that was it...My prolonged use gave me cartoonvision where everything happened in cartoon form alongside reality but that went away when I got hooked on H now I am off of both and fine....""Ok so from that it sounds like I need to eat one of your 10 strips Tess!

I've ordered from Tess a few times and would definitely say he's a fantastic vendor. He even reshipped some hits to me when a weak batch went out a while back. I've never had another vendor do that in real life or internet drugs. I just received my first Tess order from SR2. Looks great and reagent test approves of course. Stealth is amazing as always. I hope to stay connected with Tess no matter what happens in these crazy markets.knuckles-I've been doing a good amount of LSD with 2CB for the last year or so. For us it's great to take a nice dose of acid and when the peak feels like it's started to wear off we do some bumps of 2cb. Usually 10-15mg is good when snorted. Snorting 2cb hurts like fucking hell for about 10 minutes then it's all fun and games. I found 2cb to be pretty underwhelming when swallowed at around 20-30mg. It's mainly just a booster for when I want my acid trips to last longer. I think we did it while peaking once and it was pretty intense but I like to enjoy the lucy by itself for a while. It's so clean and beautiful!It all depends on where you're wanting to go with the night. We've slowly worked our way up to being comfortable on about 500ug doses. I'm trying to work my way up there to about 1000ug eventually. We've been taking it a little slower since there were some intense experiences along the way. We've learned that smoking weed before the peak is over is generally just a bad idea. Some people love it and I smoked while tripping for years but it makes my thoughts get all mixed up and loopy. Easily spirals into paranoia and confusion. It actually taught me a lot about how weed effects me that I never realized before.It can be realllly fun to do nitrous on acid. Instantly bumps the trip up to 11 for a few minutes. With a pretty visualizer and awesome music on a nice system... It's like heaven in a balloon! We've pretty much got it down to a science and mostly eliminated the incidences of passing out. Have to be kind of careful with how you take it. We can get pretty carried away doing that so it's good to take a break and go outside. Tripping in nature or a concert is amazing!Enough rambling from me I guess.

So this is the first blotter I've had in a while and also the first good blotter I've had (before we found our local guy blotter was pretty meh weak 75ug or less stuff). Two tabs of BV's product were a fun trip. Definitely agree with 140ug/tab. Took about 45 minutes to come up. Great visuals and a nice clean feeling trip. Sometimes I get a bit of a muddled headspace on acid but on this I could think so clearly. Lots of nice connected-with-the-universe vibes the whole time . We tripped out to a lot of different music (some chiptunes a bit of dubstep some house)Â  then took a walk around the park. Came back and chilled out to Boards of Canada at about peak time. My friend has a RGB laser projector (he does lighting for shows and such) so we looked at the pretty patterns as they dripped off the wall and got all fractally. Great times! Whee.Gonna candyflip with this and Tess's MDMA at a party soon Going to place a 2C-B order soon too as soon as these coins get through the tumbler. Great professional vendor. I can't recommend him enough.Edit: eh I was going to give him a 9 for quality because our usual liquid L is so clearly a 10 but I'm still feelin' the good vibes so BV gets a 10 too.","psychedelics","333",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This guy truly cares about the safety of his customersSpeed: Shipped it out next day and even made an exception so I had it on time. Really went the extra mile to hook it up.Product: AWESOME! First time I tried acid it was actually real acid. Ever since I've been getting sold nbome and for awhile enjoyed nbome until taking 3 hits one night and feeling like I was going to die...I dropped 1 tab for a party. I had the place raved out and was djing too. It was so clean once it started kicking in an hour later a beer sounded so good and started putting down beers. Try drinking anything on nbome and it all taste like dirty metal.Had a blast! Everyone was loving the music girls were loving me because I was the music maker haha. Was very chill and relaxed not edgy like nbome. I honestly can't say much about the trip at this time I was really wrapped up in the moment to enjoy the visuals or spiritual thoughts etc. What I can tell you is take one and go to a club and enjoy yourself. Its great to party on.This weekend though I am going to drop two for a music fest and come back with a better report! Will most likely drop ~200mg towards the end of some 83%+ mdma.

Here's what I can say so far (I'll come and edit later)T+0 no bitter taste! No NBomes! I'm already excited!T+60 getting that weird butterfly feeling in my stomach. That anxious feeling where you know its coming. I'm out quick to run a few errands before this hits me. I'm a huge nerd so I thought some colorful video games would be a fun time on this sample while I just hang out at home. T+90 really getting stomach feeling. Also getting that strange feeling in my head thats hard to explain kind of like my sinuses in my cheeks forehead and nose tingle that I always get when I eat acid. Starting to get that sort of glowy aura around everything that you get once you're really coming up. Gonna chill on the couch a bit play some video games and with the cat and I'll update more laterT+120 pretty much peaking here it seems. Pretty good visuals colors have that glow to them watching patterns come in and out of the hardwood. Not too much introspection though. T+180 still riding it out. Visuals are about the same pretty much watching colors explode on the screen while playing some games. T+300 The trip's pretty much run its course. Had a nice time and and am going to pop some diazepam and chill at home the rest of the night. OverallFrom my experience I'd say the dosage is pretty on at about 120-150ug a hit.Visuals were nice and mild (mild in a good way as in I wasn't freaking out or getting paranoid about anything just watching the grains in my hardwood floor melt like they were fluid and liquid colors glowing in and out and watching fractals/geometric shapes morph in and out of the wall) not much introspection or much of a ""head high"" as some call it but that's not where I wanted to go with this trip. I didn't smoke any weed or take any other drugs so my experience is purely just from 1 hit of DOSEO's swiss fluff. So take that into consideration. 2 hits would have had me trippin' hard I'm sure. Either way I had a great time just off one hit and would recommend it to anyone looking for some good 'cid shipped from the US. Thanks DOSEO!","psychedelics","408",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

First with the body highÂ  then slight visuals. i layed on the floor and tripped on the celing for awhile and it was alright. the best part about the trip was when i left my friends house to go home. I thought i was completely done tripping it was 3am so im drivin home an all the lights are just rediculously bright at a almost hypnotizing state. i was listening to daft punk which was trippy. i got home and went straight to bed. Honestly i prefer acid so i may be biased but if your looking for strong trip with lots of visuals i wouldnt recommend. if your looking for mild trip with amazing body high this is for you. i enjoyed the shrooms though it was a very calm experience. i give them a 7/10.

"60",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","QuoteWhat are the differences are in terms of storage and degradation between 2C-B Hbr and HCl? Pricing? Purity? What is generally preferred and why?From a chemistry perspective 2C-B HBr powder is less strong per mg since 2C-B HCl is 296.5g/mol and 2C-B HBr is 341g/mol while the hydrated 2C-B HBr is 359g/mol. There's no real way to tell if the 2CB-Hbr that BV is selling is hydrated or not (""wet"" has nothing to do with it both are powders).So for a given dose (say 20mg) of 2C-B HBr the effects will be slightly weaker than that same dose of 2C-B HCl. The hydrated form is ~17% less active; the anhydrous form ~13% less active.So your subjective effects will be a bit on the low side for a given dose if you go by the chart on Erowid but... not by much. Start low with your planned dose and you can always bump up the dose a tiny bit next time without much risk since even very strong doses will be physically safe.The HBr powder is an intermediate step in the synthesis which means it is somewhat cheaper to produce; the last part of the synthesis requires vacuum distillation according to PiHKAL which is somewhat specialized / expensive. It also will get higher yield since the HBr salt will weigh more.TL;DR: somewhat less active everything else is the same nobody should care because you'll still have a fun time.","psychedelics","238",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"61",NA,"lsd trip report","     Me and my buddies planned a trip up to my friends fishing camp to hangout fish drink and of course trip on some LSD. I will start off by saying this trip was nothing we expected.      So my local L connection fell through the day before we were supposed to leave so we were scrambling around trying to find acid or shrooms for the trip. We ended up finding a guy and I try not to take shit from people I don't know but one of my friends bought from him before and he said it was legit. This guy is really trying to jew us on the price he wanted $200 for twelve hits. We were so goddamn desperate we settled on $150 for 12. And the guy kept giving us that bullshit ""it's double laid twice as potent blah blah blah. "" I never believe that shit.      So we finally get the acid and get on the road at like 8 at night and drive 5 hours to the camp. My friends were all smoking blunts and hooked up the vaporizer for the ride up. They copped a half to blow for the weekend. I didn't smoke because I can't because of work. (Holy fuck I get to smoke again in less than a week I'm so fucking excited) We ended up getting there after 1:00 in the morning and we turned the electricity on and got the air condition on. We planned to fish and drink the first day and trip the next day. It didn't end up happening like that.      Once we woke up we walked down to the dock to find the bridge to the floating dock was broken fuck. So we assessed the situation made a plan and headed to the hardware store which was not close. Got us some new bolts new hinges and a 2x6. We finally got it fixed at around 2:00 in the afternoon. We were so excited to trip we decided to just eat the tabs and enjoy the ride. +Dose+Me: 4 tabsJuice: 3 tabsYeti: 3 tabsDoeback: 2 tabsI've tripped over 20 times with juice and yeti  but this was doeback's first trip.      The acid hit us like a ton of fucking bricks. I've never had such a harsh come up from acid. It hit me in like 10 minutes. Yeti threw up I was feeling queezy and we all decided to get off the floating dock for now.      By the time we moved our chairs and the radio I was full blown tripping extremely hard. This was about 30 minutes in. It started off like a normal 3 hit trip for me and just got more and more intense by the minute.      We were sitting on a porch on the side of a hill completely surrounded by trees it was so beautiful. Absolutely everything I looked at was moving in 10 different directions at once while swaying and turning inside of itself. The longer I looked at something the more intricate it became. It would stay like that even after I looked away so I began focusing on everything I was interested and it felt like mother nature was my canvas and I was a psychedelic mind artist. I was tripping so hard I couldn't listen to a complete sentence without becoming confused. My mind eventually tuned out all of my friends.      Time was going slower than it had ever seemed before. By this point I was only an hour in. At one point our trip sitter said ""do yall remember the last time I told yall what time it was?"" I couldn't even remember the last time he told me but it seemed like at least an hour ago if not more. He then said ""it has only been 5 minutes"" I was completely blown away and it frightened me a little bit. I felt myself slipping. I then began to engage in what conversation I could and I felt more in touch with 'reality' but I was in a completely different world. Trees were not trees I couldn't distinguish anything around me as a real object everything was just a huge psychedelic mix of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.      At one point I remember I was staring at the old wooden 2x4 handrail and I was getting lost looking into the patterns and our sober friend placed a blue dasani water bottle where I was staring and it blew my mind. The blue looked so unnatural since I had been staring at greens and Browns. I kept staring and it appeared that the water bottle made the handrail droop all the way down to the ground.      After a while longer I forgot I was tripping. I thought this was just how life always was. I couldn't even fathom that the radio was playing pink floyd Jim hendrix the flaming lips Radiohead or anything else. I thought that life always sounded like that.      I spent a good bit of time with my eyes closed. My closed eyed visuals were the most beautiful intricate patterns of undistinguishable colors I have ever seen besides on dmt trips. I would close my eyes for less than a minute and open them to a world I couldn't recognize. But then I began to think hey I've been here before. (My first trip ever I took 4 grams of penis envy shrooms and had complete ego death) I was back to this strange magical world I began my psychedelic experience on.      After about what seemed like 30 minutes of trying to get everyone on the same page and not confused we decided to move back down to the floating dock. I could barley stand. Walking was hard for me it was very strange. My depth perception was all kinds of fucked up. The ten foot catwalk to the dock looked like 50 feet long. It was over water with no handrails and I was scared to cross it. When I finally did I experienced some of the most amazing feelings during my LSD trip.      We go to the dock on open water the wind was blowing Jimi Hendrix was making 60 foot pine trees across the lake bend twist dance and spiral to his music. I felt a huge rush of euphoria and was literally speechless from the beauty I was witnessing. Unfortunately this did not last for long as our trip took an unexpected turn.      We chose the camp because we were not supposed to have any other interaction with strangers it would be just us. When we were on the dock a boat that was fishing was getting closer and closer and I began to feel uncomfortable. I then realized this is a very popular place to fish and he was just enjoying the beautiful weather like us. But my other friend juice did not keep a level head. We asked him if he was catching any fish and just having casual conversation and I believe we were doing good and seemed 'normal.' Juice was wearing a coast guard shirt and the fisherman asked if he was in the coast guard and he replied ""no my brother is *insert name here* do you know him?"" The fisherman said no and my friend took it the wrong way. He couldn't understand that obviously someone in the coast guard won't know everyone. Doeback then said ""yeah he's black"" just trying to help the fisherman visualize my friends brother and that pissed juice off. He thought the fisherman was being disrespectful and he started yelling at him and cursing him out. He was freaking everyone out. The fisherman drove off and my friend couldn't get it out his head. He then got stuck in a loop.      He would calm down and then start yelling and saying we were going to go beat that guy up. I kept saying ""Juice you're killing the vibe. He's gone just chill out."" He kept losing it everyone 60 seconds or so. He then started running towards the house. I chased him down trying to calm him down but it wouldn't work.      We decided he needs to smoke some weed and we went inside and the scenery change being inside of an old cabin fucked with everyone's head. Juice then starting losing who he was as a person. Crying yelling  trying to run out. I literally had to hold him down on the couch. At this point I am peaking hard as fuck and I keep hearing him mumble jibberish and yelling random memories from throughout his life and I began to get lost in his thoughts. Me trying to take care of him made me lose my sense of self. I still stayed with him trying to comfort him I hugged him cried with him and did whatever I could to calm him down. I began to think me and him were the same mind and his memories were mine as well.      My other friends immediately took doeback the first timer away from juice because we didn't want to ruin his first trip. So I was inside with him alone and I lost reality. I thought my entire life existed in the room I was in. I looked around. The carpet was a kaliesdcope  the ceiling looked like a white ocean the walls were swaying like crazy. It was very intense to be in a very small room.       Our trip sitter came back in after what seemed like an eternity and sat next to us on the couch and he looked at me and said ""you can go I got this"" I said ""what do you mean"" he replied ""you can go outside"" I began to start seeing and thinking clearer. I grabbed my wallet looked at my drivers license I was back.      It was dark outside at this point I think it was around maybe 10 o'clock or so. I grabbed the glowsticks and headed down the the dock. Yeti and doeback were surprised to see me but welcomed me back. We sat listening to music and just talked for the rest of the trip and played with some glowsticks. Overall I had a good trip. I was just disappointed I didn't get to watch the sun go down while I was peaking that hard. The next day I went out on the canoe with juice and told him what happened and talked to him about it. I'm the only other one that has lost it like him except I was worse off. (From a Shroom trip) We talked about what he remembered and just like I did he took the good out of it and he worked out some old grudges and things that were bothering him in the process. We plan on headed back up there soon I plan on taking a nice 500ug trip. So in the end I believe these were around 200ug tabs so that makes my dose around 800ug. From my experience with my body and how I handle LSD I think that is pretty accurate. I want to take a 800ug dose of Order of the Phoenix's acid so I can get a good comparison though. It was a sort of long read and I appreciate your time and if you have any questions please ask.","psychedelics","1929",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mine was one of the orders with messed up pricing but instead of cancelling he marked mine as shipped.I never received anything. I contacted Nelson about this and he told me that I should use the dispute center on SR and we would determine the best possible way to get a refund.

I don't know if there's anything that I can do about it at this point but I am 99% positive that Nelson Muntz was supposed to cancel my order but instead marked it shipped when he did not send any LSD to begin with; he even told me multiple times that he has a 100% success rate on LSD shipments.

No LSD no money not even a courtesy ""fuck you"" message from SR staff to tell me that my money was being seized.I'm not happy at all with the way that SR staff handled my dispute and I don't want to make this post seem like an attack at Nelson Muntz because as far as I know the only thing he did wrong was make an honest mistake about cancelling my order. Now I'm getting assfucked from every direction when all I wanted to do was make an honest order of LSD and pay for it the way that this site was intended to work.

Simply put this is some great great meth I have used a number of EU vendors on SR1 and BMR and sheep none of who wer great. When it has come down to domestic but we have been spoilt recently IMO in UK with BBMC having some great gear as has Mr Merlin.Well Hiniguels is right up there as in its some of best meth ive had pleasure in trying. If you can keep solid supply of more top tier product then im going to be one wide awake but happy motherfucker. Only problem is it is likely to be new year before I will get chance to place another order because of SR down time hapening before the date I get paid again  O well heres hoping for the lotto to come up in mean time. Im dieing to know what rest of you thought of this batch of meth particularly if you have sampled Merlins last offering and BBMC's gear as I cant decide who's product I like more Hiniguel or BBMC I always enjoyed Merlins gear but last batch gave me some weird side effects which put me off. Plus I always think the bag you are currently smoking always seems the best untill it runs out then when I sober u I can make better comparissions. Another great positive with HIniguel is his quick comms and general helpful attitude via forums and via messaging which maybe some of you dont care about but I get some kind of reassurance ordering from someone who comess across as being genuine and not just a dick. Infact this has been the case with any dealings Ive had with any of the UK vendors Ive used but it meant a lot when Hiniguel went out of his way to post orders even while site was down and that so I feel it needs recognised.

I will return in january 2014 but it is now clear that there will be very low stock for all of 2014. This 2013 west coast season for wild psilocybe cyanescens was one of the worst on record. Most hunters did not get anything at all and those that did the season was much shorter than normalthe harvest this year was only 20% of normal so it will be extremely limited for all of 2014 until next november. I do not want to raise the prices and have them go to the highest bidder. i still support the little guy and want to give new people a chance to try this rare species. So it will be a little bit like a lottery. I will be open a few days a week with a set small amount each week so everyone will still get a chance at it if you are patient and get there at the right time. usually it will be toward the later part of the week unless i take a real vacation and then I will come back the next weekThere's nothing anybody can do about it. You can't grow these out of season so we all have to make the best of what Mother Nature throws at us. These things go in cycles so some years there will be extras and better deals but not this yearAnyway Happy New Years and I will return first week in January unless something major happens. Here's a few articles from the old SR1 forumshttp://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/06/us-depression-magicmushrooms-idUSBRE9350BF20130406http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/news/article3733151.eceFirst magic mushroom depression trial hits stumbling blockBy Kate KellandLONDON | Sat Apr 6 2013 7:18pm EDT(Reuters) - The world's first clinical trial designed to explore using a hallucinogen from magic mushrooms to treat people with depression has stalled because of British and European rules on the use of illegal drugs in research.David Nutt president of the British Neuroscience Association and professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London said he had been granted an ethical green light and funding for the trial but regulations were blocking it.""We live in a world of insanity in terms of regulating drugs"" he told a neuroscience conference in London on Sunday.He has previously conducted small experiments on healthy volunteers and found that psilocybin the psychedelic ingredient in magic mushrooms has the potential to alleviate severe forms of depression in people who don't respond to other treatments.Following these promising early results he was awarded a 550000 pounds ($844000) grant from the UK's Medical Research Council to conduct a full clinical trial in patients.But psilocybin is illegal in Britain and under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances it is classified as a Schedule 1 drug - one that has a high potential for abuse and no recognized medical use.This Nutt explained means scientists need a special license to use magic mushrooms for trials in Britain and the manufacture of a synthetic form of psilocybin for use in patients is tightly controlled by European Union regulations.Together this has meant he has so far been unable to find a company able to make and supply the drug for his trial he said.""Finding companies who could manufacture the drug and who are prepared to go through the regulatory hoops to get the license which can take up to a year and triple the price is proving very difficult"" he said.Nutt said regulatory authorities have a ""primitive old-fashioned attitude that Schedule 1 drugs could never have therapeutic potential"" despite the fact that his research and the work done by other teams suggests such drugs may help treat some patients with psychiatric disorders.Psilocybin - or ""magic"" - mushrooms grow naturally around the world and have been widely used since ancient times for religious rites and also for recreation.Researchers in the United States have seen positive results in trials using MDMA a pure form of the party drug ecstasy in treating post-traumatic stress disorder.""What we are trying to do is to tap into the reservoir of under-researched illegal drugs to see if we can find new and beneficial uses for them in people whose lives are often severely affected by illnesses such as depression"" Nutt said.The proposed trial would involve 60 patients with depression who have failed two previous treatments.During two or three controlled sessions with a therapist half would be given a synthetic form of psilocybin and the other 30 a placebo. They would have guided talking therapy to explore negative thinking and issues troubling them and doctors would follow them up for at least a year.Nutt secured ethical approval for the trial in March.In previous research Nutt found that when healthy volunteers were injected with psilocybin the drug switched off a part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex which is known to be overactive in people with depression.""Even in normal people the more that part of the brain was switched off under the influence of the drug the better they felt two weeks later. So there was a relationship between that transient switching off of the brain circuit and their subsequent mood"" he said. ""This is the basis on which we want to run the trial.""(Reporting by Kate Kelland editing by Richard Meares)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/the-psychedelic-countess-on-a-mushroom-mission-to-free-your-mind-8573178.htmlby Nick Curtiss April 15 2013I do not doubt for one moment the absolute sincerity of the drugs campaigner Amanda Feilding aka Lady Neidpath Countess of Wemyss and March. Nor the good sense in her argument that narcotics should be scientifically studied decriminalised and licensed and regulated by the state for medical or recreational use as appropriate — a “sensible” alternative to the vast waste of lives and money in the unwinnable War on Drugs. But I can see how easy it is for her opponents to demonise the 70-year-old as a batty aristo.The ex-artist and mother of two is the product of one grand family traceable back to Charles II and she married aged 53 into another richer one which gives her clipped pronouncements on social policy a distinct whiff of de haut en bas. A pivot-point in her bohemian life came when she drilled a hole in her own skull in 1970: her long-term partner and father of her sons Chelsea gallerist Joseph Mellen and her husband Jamie Charteris Lord Neidpath have also had it done. Feilding still believes trepanation is an important tool in the study of consciousness which is the root of all her work but prefers not to talk about it in case it gives ammo to her political enemies.Much of her life has been dedicated to the idea that psychoactive drugs such as psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) LSD and cannabis as opposed to heroin and cocaine can do good as well as harm. So this is an exciting time. The Medical Research Council has stumped up £550000 for Professor David Nutt’s team at Imperial College to test the use of psilocybin to treat depression. This was on the basis of earlier research by Nutt initiated and funded by the Beckley Foundation which Feilding set up in 1998 and runs from her ancestral Tudor home outside Oxford.The early tests showed that in subjects at rest psilocybin decreased blood supply to a system in the brain called “the default mode network which is the modern terminology for the ego”. This means the brain becomes “looser more anarchic but it also means that the repression is lessened so that traumatic memories can be accessed and cleaned out”. It ties in with similar research the Beckley is running with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore into the use of psilocybin alongside psychotherapy to deal with treatment-resistant addiction in this case smoking. “So far we have got a more or less 100 per cent success rate” enthuses Feilding.These tests couldn’t have happened 10 years ago because the brain-imaging technology wasn’t available and nor was the political will. Back in 2002 Feilding suggested to neuroscientist Colin Blakemore that they devise a scale of harm and benefits of psychoactive drugs. He pointed out that not just all the research but all the terminology only indicated the damage drugs did: the idea of benefits was anathema.This she ascribes to a knee-jerk error of the Sixties. “LSD was discovered by Albert Hoffman in 1943 and it became in the Fifties the new wonder drug of doctors and psychotherapists” she says. “Then because it got out into the recreational world and was misused and became associated with counterculture and revolution that put it under taboo for 50 years. I think society made a mistake by simplifying the issue.” She set up the Beckley to work on both scientific research and social policy believing the two are symbiotic.Her argument is pretty straightforward: that criminalisation of drugs perpetuates the $50?billion worldwide trade and “destabilises countries ruins the environment makes people kill each other … The horrors on the Mexican-American border! People become completely inhuman they can skin people do horrible things. But if you take the policy harms out of the equation the actual damage these substances cause in terms of the deaths they cause is pretty minimal.“There is so much money involved in the illicit trade you cannot close it off. Surely the governments of the world must be able to regulate these things in a more harm-reducing way than criminal cartels whose only motive is profit? The success of a drugs policy should not be judged on how many people we imprison or how many drugs we capture at the border: health harm reduction cost effectiveness and human rights should be our aims.”The day before we met Archbishop Desmond Tutu had signed the Beckley Foundation’s public letter calling for a rethink of global drugs policy. Other signatories include the presidents of Colombia and Guatemala several ex-premiers and former US presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter a host of Nobel Prize winners Sir Richard Branson Sting and Yoko Ono. Another signatory founding president of Facebook and Spotify Sean Parker has given money to the Beckley and Yoko Ono (Feilding’s accent renders it “Yerker Earner”) made a donation instead of a wedding present when Feilding’s son Rocky got married. But most of its money comes from other foundations: Getty Soros Flora. Lord Neidpath is hugely wealthy and landed and is “very supportive” but doesn’t chip in: “It’s not his thing.” So Feilding works herself “almost to my death 15 hours a day seven days a week to raise every penny”.Now the tide may be turning. The legalisation of cannabis in Washington state and Colorado “makes it harder for [the US] to criminalise the countries of Latin America. But progress is slow. If it was hard to win ethical approval for psilocybin tests it’s even harder to get the stuff itself thanks to stringent EU regulations.“No manufacturer wants to get involved in it: it’s too much paperwork for the tiny amount we need” Feilding says. “So though one can go out and buy it on the street one can’t get it for scientific research.”It is still hard to have a grown-up unhysterical conversation about drugs. One newspaper scented conspiracy this week in the fact that the Government’s current drugs czar Professor Les Iversen was listed on the Beckley’s advisory board. Nutt his predecessor as drugs czar was fired for stating that cannabis was less dangerous than alcohol and cigarettes and ecstasy less risky than horse-riding. Feilding likens this to the Vatican’s treatment of Galileo.She is a persuasive talker but what makes her such a complicated advocate — and an easy target for critics — is that her perspective seems incredibly rarefied. What does she know of crack dealers in Baltimore or youths smoking skunk in London squats? She is descended from the Earls of Denbigh and Desmond and grew up in Beckley Park with its three moats and extensive grounds. “We had absolutely no money no heating no petrol no toys or friends or anything” she insists. “No one came here: it was a frozen isolated world.”I ask what her father did: “Well he did nothing. He was charming he painted he was a passionate lover of beauty and he kind of half-heartedly farmed.” The absolute lack of money is a recurring theme but she also tells me she bought Beckley Park off her siblings “when it came on the open market” and our refreshments are brought by a factotum.As a teenager Feilding had “a passion for mystics and alternative religions” and left school at 16 with £50 in her pocket in search of a godfather whom she had never met but who had become a Buddhist monk in Ceylon. She never found him but had “amazing adventures lived with the Bedouin in the desert”. Later she taught herself about psychology and physiology and brain studies and became a painter.In 1966 she met the Dutch advocate of trepanation Dr Bart Hughes and from the late Sixties she was living with Mellen with whom she had two sons Rock or “Rocky” (born 1979 and now a Conservative councillor in Kensington and Chelsea) and Cosmo (born 1985 and a film-maker). Her grisly trepanation is viewable online: she stood for Parliament in Chelsea in 1979 and 1983 on the single issue of getting the procedure provided by the NHS getting 40 votes the first time and 139 the second.I ask her what drugs she tried in her youth. “Well before psychedelics were illegal I tried psychedelics and came to recognise their great potential value  but also their potential for damage if misused.” To you or to others? “Um both.” When I ask if she still indulges she gives me a narrow look and says: “We live in a heavily criminalised society.” But she has been able to educate her sons “properly” about drugs because they know she won’t bullshit them.As for trepanation — no neither her sons nor her husband’s children Mary the model and Dick the lawyer (Lord Elcho) from Jamie’s first marriage to Catherine Guinness have been drilled. But Feilding is conducting research in St Petersburg  with Dr Yuri Moskalenko that seems to suggest the improved circulation of blood and cerebrospinal fluid attained through trepanation “washes out the big toxic molecules” that cause Alzheimer’s and dementia. Trepanation freed her husband a former Oxford academic who taught international relations to Bill Clinton from crippling headaches. “It’s been done in every culture since 10000BC” she says airily. “Then it got a bad name in the First World War when they started performing lobotomies.”Feilding married her husband in 1995 at the Bent pyramid in Egypt: both remain “best friends” with her ex Mellen. They divide their time between Beckley Park his nearby Jacobean seat Stanway and her house in Chelsea which she has hung onto since 1965 for sentimental reasons: a pigeon chick she saved and fed bits of Weetabix on the end of a paintbrush returned there for 15 years.I know I know. All of this has nothing to do with her very earnest desire to improve our understanding of and attitude to drugs here and worldwide. And sometimes I find myself thinking: if eccentric toffs didn’t undertake these crusades who would? “Will you try not to make me sound a complete fool?” says Lady Neidpath graciously as I go. I hope I haven’t.beckleyfoundation.org-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Re: cyanspore reviews - psilocybe cyanescens« Reply #117 on: May 24 2013 03:39 pm »this is told to me from one of my customers who will will remain anonymous but he gave me permission to post it.

I just felt happy.  Happy andoptimistic and energized... and it lasted so long I dared to hope that this wasthe new me at least for a good while.  And then suddenly it all left.  Theenthusiasm drained out of me and I suddenly felt heavy and dull.  Like normal.I tried to stay optimistic and think that having just come down from such aheight I was bound to bounce back up a little.  As long as I ended up betterthan I was before the experiment would be a success.  The next day I honestlydon't know if I'm better now or not.  I'm certainly not worse and I value whatI felt while it lasted but I'm also really sad that it couldn't last.  Near theend I felt like I wanted to try anything and everything go out into the world Inormally feared and appreciate everything.  I passionately wanted to help otherpeople like me who felt hopeless and powerless to help themselves.  Now it'smore cautious optimism.  I want to learn more trip again grow my own.  I can'tsay my life is changed...yet.  It's more like I went on a brief but wonderfulvacation and I treasure the memory of it.  It's more happiness in one eveningthan I've felt in years.  So thank you so very very much for that.    ""Second letter about a week ago""Greetings again.  I\'m that guy who ordered awhile back because he was interested in using mushrooms to treat my depression.  In addition to finally ordering again you wanted to know how the experiment went. I don\'t remember exactly what I said last time but I\'m sure I reported a wonderful experience while tripping but I wasn\'t sure of any lasting effects.  Well I can now confidently report that there HAS been a positive lasting effect it\'s just significantly more obvious to everyone else than it is to me. My wife has been really enjoying what she calls \""**** 2.0\"" who seems to be more confident less prone to frustration and despair and a massively better communicator.  All I really notice is that discussions that used to turn into arguments don\'t anymore and apparently that\'s all due to me.  Other little things too like strangers are more likely to engage me now.  Like there was something in my face before that just screamed \""leave me the hell alone\"" (despite me desperately wishing for the opposite) but now I\'ve got drive-thru attendants spontaneously wanting to chat me up.  That NEVER happens.Oh and I don\'t entertain killing myself anymore.  Life hasn\'t gotten easier it\'s still pretty screwed up and I\'m plenty frustrated but I\'d rather keep trying to work through it than be dead.  It really was that bad before.My wife finally worked up the nerve to take the other gram (thank you again for that) and she had a very different experience than me.  A brief period of visual hallucination... vivid colors a bit of ceiling movement and she looked in the mirror and saw herself the way I saw her... beautiful!  But that seemed to pass quickly and she got very introspective and spent awhile talking about painful times in her past.  Stuff that\'s shaped who she is now and has kept pretty bottled up.  She cried a lot and hard.  No regrets for her or me but she\'s not sure what hers was about.  And neither of us are sure yet if there\'s been any lasting effect although she has reported that she sleeps better. We\'re both wondering though does that sound like her dose had a stronger or lesser effect?  It\'s not obvious which way it went because it was just so DIFFERENT but she definitely would like to have a trip more like mine.  Less introspection more unbridled joy and beauty.  It was the same dose as near as I could eyeball it.  She\'s significantly lighter than me and I\'m not sure but I think she smoked a little weed beforehand to ease her nervousness (first time for her too).  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Anyway thank you again for opening this door for me and I look forward to re-visiting it soon!""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------http://www.medicaldaily.com/articles/17161/20130706/chemical-magic-mushrooms-psilocybin-help-people-ptsd.htmChemical in Magic Mushrooms Psilocybin May Help People With PTSD Overcome FearSome people with PTSD use medical marijuana to treat their symptoms but the chemical psilocybin could be a better treatment if it's proven to combat fear conditioning in human trials.By Anthony Rivas | Jul 06 2013 04:49 PM EDTTagspost-traumatic stress disorder PTSD mushrooms psychedelicNormally the thought of magic mushrooms in relation to people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) would conjure images of the person freaking out from their fears taking shape in hallucinations. But researchers have just found that low doses of the psychedelic compound in magic mushrooms known as psilocybin (PSOP) may be able to help people overcome their fears at a faster rate.    (Photo : Wikimedia Commons ) Small doses of the compound psilocybin which is derived from magic mushrooms may be the next form of treatment for PTSD if they're proven useful in combating fear conditioningEnlarge(Photo : Wikimedia Commons ) Small doses of the compound psilocybin which is derived from magic mushrooms may be the next form of treatment for PTSD if they're proven useful in combating fear conditioningThe study conducted on mice could have implications for humans suffering from PTSD. Researchers from the Lieber Institute for Brain Development wanted to see how PSOP affected the brain's learning and removal of a conditioned fear response.They injected mice with PSOP saline — as the control — and ketanserin which counteracts the receptor that binds PSOP in the brain. The mice were put into a testing chamber where they were conditioned to become fearful of a 15-second audio cue which was followed 30 seconds later by brief electric shocks through the floor. After the researchers did this 10 times with about three minutes in-between each shock all of the animals had become feaful of the sound cue and would freeze upon hearing it.The next day the mice were put back in the chamber but although the cue would sound there was no shock that followed. The researchers wanted to wean the mice out of being scared by teaching them that the sound no longer meant a shock. After only three sounds of the cue the mice treated with the low doses of PSOP — low enough for them to avoid hallucinations — were able to stop freezing upon hearing the cue. Mice that were given higher doses of PSOP or the ketanserin froze until the tenth trial and mice given the control continued to freeze after the tenth trial.While the researchers aren't exactly sure why the PSOP was able to stop the mice from freezing so fast they say it could be because the drug is able to modify and control neural circuits. The mice that received low doses of PSOP also showed higher rates of brain cell growth or neurogenesis.""At the low doses of PSOP that enhanced extinction neurogenesis was not decreased but rather tended toward an increase"" they wrote. ""Extinction of 'fear conditioning' may be mediated by actions of the drugs at sites other than hippocampus such as the amygdala which is known to mediate the perception of fear.""In other words PSOP seemed to promote growth of new brain cells that helped erase memories including those of the fear response.""Memory learning and the ability to relearn that a once threatening stimuli is no longer a danger absolutely depends on the ability of the brain to alter its connections"" Dr. Briony Catlow lead author of the study told Real Clear Science. ""We believe that neuroplasticity plays a critical role in psilocybin accelerating fear extinction""Because PTSD is believed to arise from similar fear conditioning Dr. Catlow believes that using PSOP in humans with PTSD could be a possible treatment. The disorder affects almost 7.7 million adults in the U.S. and according to a 2006 analysis of military records from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study 15 to 19 percent of Vietnam veterans experienced PTSD at some point after the war. With regards to the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts of the 1.7 million soldiers who served 20 percent have been diagnosed with PTSD.Source:Catlow B Song S Sanchez-Ramos J et al.

Really have to pay attention because the change is QUICK I missed the yellow first time around.MECKE test with a yellow/brown result - in line with 2c-b.I marquis tested some previous 2c-b (from Mahakala) with an almost identical result------------------------P.S. Will update this post with the exact weight of product received and also with an experience report when the time is right (recovering from a pretty exhausing DOB trip this weekend). But for the time being Thanks for being a stand-up comrade. Let Odin's ravens protect you always.

It took about and hour to an hour and a half for all of us to come up. The come up was very smooth and easy on the body. The trip wasn't very visual in the beginning but by the 3-4 hr point we all had beautiful visuals accompanying the very clear head space. One of my friends had an ego death from just one and a half tabs! (he is new to psychedelics and appears to be slightly sensitive to them). I was able to fall asleep at about 11 hours in without the help of any benzos or sleeping aids. All in all Tessellated's LSD is very clean and definitely 200ug per tab as advertised.                                                                                                                                    Your friend in Wonderland                                                                                                                                                                Alice Dee","psychedelics","288",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I spent the afternoon listening to music and messing about with the cats.Now i feel great no come down and nice gentle back to normal as if i had not done anything.These were 200ug so that should have been 400ug today.

"81",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Did not realize there was this thread specifically for Tess reviews. Reposting from another thread I originally placed this in...My review:Shipping: 5/5 - Slower than I expected from Canada but still within the range I was told. Can't complain.Stealth: 6/5 - AMAZING stealth. It took me and a friend about 5 minutes to figure out where the hell the blotters were.Quality: 6/5 - I've done shrooms a number of times and acid only once (Tess' tabs) but the LSD beats out any of my shroom trips by a lot.I did not experience many visuals beyond walls breathing or some minor 'illusions' I would call them but that's not what I was looking for with LSD anyways. Even having had a huge fight with my mom for the last week before the trip (probably wasn't a good idea to take them at this point but it helped me solve some problems) the world had never been more beautiful. I felt like a child again and ran around in a field of snow with my friends watching for probably 30 minutes before falling over and staring at the AMAZING sky simply watching the clouds float by and relishing in the colors I was seeing.Once my friends and I finally decided it was time to go inside (started getting dark) things toned down a bit. I just watched some videos and listened to music on my laptop but everything was still beyond great. In the rare moments where I had a bad thought I found it very easy to tell myself ""This is LSD. Nothing bad can happen"" and calmed down. It was a very controlled trip analogous I'd say to any shroom trip I've been on being a regular dream where you have no control over anything going on vs. lucid dreaming where you take the reins. I'm not a poet but hopefully that makes sense. It was very obviously EXTREMELY clean LSD.The trip lasted about 8 hours or so but I probably had some cross-tolerance from shrooms four days before. For my friend the trip lasted closer to 10-11 hours.While I've not had other LSD from any other vendors to compare with Tessellated's reputation I'd say there's no going wrong buying from them/him/her. It's touted as the best of the best and from my limited (so far) experience that's no over-exaggeration.Beyond Tess' product though customer service is the best of any vendor I've encountered. Very quick response and while I haven't had to deal with any missing packages or anything of the like myself he seems to be on top of making the customer happy.Thanks Tess!","psychedelics","435",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"82",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","i first tried psychedelics earlier this year. tess had great communication shipping and stealth to zero tolerance japan. i'm 30 and this was my first trip.  i dosed with my girlfriend lucy around 2pm. i ate a single tab while she took 4/5ths.  we made our way to a bed resting on the floor in a boring beige room by some speakers and let the music loose. i'm not sure exactly the order but the playlist included pieces by sibelius bach borodin mozart and mussorsgky. i felt wonderful and paralysis set in quickly.  vibrant colors rippled out of what were now breathing rainbow walls. language was no longer available to me. the light at the center of the ceiling was of course spinning and the fractals spread out from the roof of the world. the last clear memory i have is of a particular open eyed visual a certain shading over. everything seemed etched out sketched in pencil somehow. as i learned from subsequent trips this shading over is something like the last signpost in the universe. past that point i scarcely exist.   music that we were both intimate with became stranger and stranger. it was if i no longer heard with my ears. music instead came dripping down from space or welling up from an unknown internal dimension. distances became impossibly vast. at some heroic moment on bald mountain i sat up to see my monitor melting in time with the beat swaying away into oblivion while disconnected notes bubbled out and burst into what consciousness i had left. lucy repeatedly tried to talk with me. no one was there to answer. everything was purple and i half remember a face coming down through the acid fueled dreamscape to kiss me.  eventually there started to be an ""i"" again. i realized i had a mouth for instance because there was some ice cream in it. i laughed for two hundred years but in an instant the next wave rose and again i was less than responsive. one particular mozart piano concerto solo and cadenza i think was the happiest point of my life. and then the happy moment ended. the computer was off inscrutably impossibly off. we both had no idea what had happened and were unable to coax the box back to life.  although i still insisted that it was absolutely logically impossible for us to leave the bed lucy eventually sought her laptop and played still more. in fact the people outside our apartment banging around somehow became part of the ensemble. we were now also more able to reflect together on the events that had happened a thousand years ago and tentatively explore our own apartment. i found it inconceivable that we might leave the room and we had to work together to make it to the living room.  there i saw the neighbor's garden growing up before my eyes into a purple sky. in the distance apartment buildings collapsed and rose again warping in and out of existence. around 8 pm we went for a walk and saw and felt many more amazing things. david attenborough explained nature to us until we fell asleep around midnight.  this changed my life. i would have never known that these mental states existed. were it not for that peak i would have never guessed that humans can be so at ease with the universe. exploring my world strengthened me and lucy and i both now feel that having gotten through LSD we can get through anything. subsequent trips have likewise changed me in different ways. thank you very much tessellated.","psychedelics","602",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The plan was initially to test the all stars are just got in. Marketed at 170mg... I reckon 120-140 is more realistic. MDMA tolerance is high... so I doubled.I normally go for the traditional lsd first then mdma but i thought just give the other method a try. Waiting about an hour for the initial e to hit then dropped 2 tessâ WoWs. From what I've read a lot of people don't want to come down to early from the E but I didn't find my 'coming down' to be bad. I was happy all day.t=0 (2 nintendo all stars..)t=1 (2 tess)Okay this is where i kinda get lost and i was reading the forums just having a ball. Lost time here..t=5 instead of redosing on mdma (cutting down..) and gave some 2c-b a good. Up my nose.. Not that bad but i suspect it dripped a lot. BUT hey the effects definitely took place. The walls started breathing. Wasn't sure if it was LSD or 2c-b but I am definitely appreciating 2c-b and can myself going to museums like our dear shulgin did. t=8? went for breakfast at at cafe. Was still having a ball and ate some gluten free toast with jam. Surprised i finished it. Normally i can't handle eating after MDMA. Mood was still great. Haha gave the cashier some a 50$ bill and the tracers were still going so I thought i handed him like 5 notes. Got him a little confused haha. Damn those tracers.t=9 got home --- tracers still very evident. Then I got into my more thinking self-reflective mode. A lot of negativity within my 'friends' (ex's group) and it just made me realise who my real friends are. They really ought to open their minds more. I just makes me happy to see them happy but they think they are the 'shit'. The tracers lasted all the way till the end. I'm trying to get some rest now. been up long.I guess that's an okay report  Very very clean acidI do apologise for grammatical errors I didn't proof-read it and I wrote it straight after my trip.

Considering it crossed a border during this crazy slow postal season","high five.I've just got around to weighing the powder and it was a generous 1015 mg not including powder stuck inside the bag and the little bit used for a reagent test. Very generous basically an additional dose on top of the promised gram weight. NOTE: I don't know if people know this but the best way to recover all the powder from a bag is to do a wash of the bag with a small amount of water/vodka to catch all the powder and throw it in a drink.Really nice texture of powder - fluffy with an absolutely slight hint of beige/tan to it but predominantly brilliant white. I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase but I don't think I'm in the mood for 2C-B at the moment because I have a few more substances slotted for experiments (aMT & new batch of DOM). I just wanted to grab a batch of 2C-B in case of emergency after all the trials the darknet has been through recently. I'm absolutely confident the substance in question is 2c-b and look forward to giving it a whirl.That said I hope to continue as a customer with BlueViking and I'm looking forward to the new batch of LSD - I normally use other LSD sources - but the opportunity for a variety pack with multiple types of LSD has me excited!","psychedelics",254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"85",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","maybe everyone is different but now I'm believing that 200ug is more than enough to have a full LSD experience. If one spaces two weeks between doses and takes one of Tess' tabs on an empty stomach ( or waits two-three hours after eating ) and gets into a relaxedmeditative state- very likely to have a strong trip with great visuals. I had to dissect why my last 200ug trip was just as  if not stronger than the 400ug trip.1) I did not expect much. So having little to expect made the onset allot more obvious and somehow enhanced it2) I cozied up to a nice drink and got relaxed. I think being calm and comfortable allows one to settle into the trip and allow one to just observe.     This is key. Just be an observerwithout any expectations. Once you start anticipating you are no longer in the recieve state.      As I looked around I really focused my vision( but just observing) - breathed deeply and brought my attention to the space between my brows. The third eye chakra is     known to be associated with psychedelic vision and intuition. As I focused the tingling began and I started to notice the subtle changes in and around me.So I know now that one can get more out of less by meditative focus. LSD is a powerful molecule- you don't need much stimulation to get the psychic engine started.  With practice one can achieve a stronger trip on less dosage. Who knows maybe after much practice one can just scrap acid and just do some meditation to augment their reality. Apparently this is the case for seasoned yogis\lamas. My ultimate point is here that we should all be confident that when you buy an x-strip of Tess you are getting x trips! Some trips may be more intense and visual than others- big whoop! A trip is a trip. One is all you need. In fact for many  half is all they need or want.     Sorry Tess not trying to fuck up your bizhaha :p     Actually it will help your biz if people get more trips on less as they will ultimately buy more. All my friends  with the exception of the drunk I told ya about all loved your acid and had very visual trips on just one tab. In my woods people will pay $20 for a tab of REAL acidcuz they know its hard to find the real deal.","psychedelics","421",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"86",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","They say set and setting is everything. This apparently proved true this past Fri night. I popped ONE of Tess' tabs and tripped harder than I ever did off of two of his. I was just chillin' in a friends apartment. I did not expect this.Â  I was sippin' on a very tall Vodka cranberry after I dosed. Within 35 min the LSD totally eclipsed any drunken feelings as I felt the love surge through me. I just cracked up laughing and said 'oh boy here we go!' DAMN the visuals were freakin crazy! Carpet looked embroidered with mandelbrot sets coiling and spinning and the whole surface appeared to shift back and forth like crashing waves. The whole room was exploding with fractalsflowing on everythingall of varied color. I put on some Jimi Hendrix. Oh man did this rock! Hendrix is so psychedelic and as I danced I noticed vortexes of swirling bluesgreensviolets enveloped my body and spun out into the air merging with the flowing fluff all over everything. As I turned my hands and arms auras of some kind of blue would get pulled in and then that color would permeate the entire room. Amazing! The warping was so wild - I could skew and almost swirl my vision like looking at a piece of paper that is bent or inside a crystal ball. The curtain shades were undulating and the door frames wiggled. At one point I went outside to star gaze. It does not fail that I always tear up at the vast beauty of the night sky and during this time I delved into deep contemplation whilst laying on my back. As thoughts about life and some recent deaths in my family swept across my mind scape they were projected as imagery in the fractalized sky. As I watched the movie play out I found comfort in knowing that there is no death only infinite spaces of reality in which we occupy for periods that we call life.","psychedelics","333",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

sun the light sending shocking shades of red orange and pink through the clouds as they danced for us.  We can't ever remember seeing a sky more beautiful.Eventually we decided to head back and upon re-entering the forest from the hillside we were greeted by this very sincere feeling of being in a magic wood.  While it wasn't quite like we were expecting a leprechaun to pop out the feeling of mysticism was strong.We stopped by this old tree grown out in the wildest of directions and my friend stood on it to get the lay of the land and bask in the purple-pink remnants of the setting sun.We eventually returned to our cabin a throwback place that was pretty much designed by artsy hippies.  Originally when we arrived prior to the trip we were amused and appreciative of the unique decor but after returning and settling back in for the night the place seemed to spring to life.  The large handpainted murals on the wall of sea creatures and ocean life began to move radiating energy and joy all around.  The disparate elements of the place now seemed to have a natural flow that was obscured before.  A large matchbox with hummingbirds and flowers printed on the front began to move the birds feeling alive in this little handheld window in front of us.And music!  Of course music.  Wilco's Sky Blue Sky was our muse for the first hour of our journey and it was remarkable.  I heard it

from one to the next in lovely cascades that moved with the sound.  But it was strange -- we all thought that while the colorful patterns were often beautiful to look at they were necessarily limited by the pixels on the screen and therefore hollow.But when the colors left the screen and spilled out into the world pixels were no longer important and instead the glow around the room created this wonderful haze of rainbow light that echoed around us.  We agreed it was interesting that something could give off qualities that it in itself could not possess and wondered how it applied to other areas of life.It was at this point we realized through all the laughter that our cheeks were hurting and bellies empty.  After some effort we put a family-sized lasagna in the microwave to cook for

stares outward.  But as my fiancee looked at me arms crossed and eyes red and stained with tears anger flowing through her the painting no longer looked beautiful but menacing the red lamp not comforting but a rageful fire.  There was this dark shadow surrounding the love of my life like a black aura that was infecting the air and walls surrounding her.  It's one thing to feel someone's anger inside it's quite another to have it infect the walls in front of you.  I will never in my life forget seeing that moment.  It was truly remarkable and I'm thankful for it (even though it wasn't under the best of circumstances).Ultimately she calmed down and we were fine for the rest of the night enjoying the comedown.  We watched Spirited Away on mute with a personal music mix playing randomly in the background.  It was surprising how often the mood of the music and even the timing fit the film so well.  And watching without the distraction of dialogue made us appreciate the animation on a new intimate level.As the film came to a close we inched past midnight said our thanks and passed into a dreamless sleep.Thank you Tess for the wonderful memories and thanks to everyone

under the best of circumstances).Ultimately she calmed down and we were fine for the rest of the night enjoying the comedown.  We watched Spirited Away on mute with a personal music mix playing randomly in the background.  It was surprising how often the mood of the music and even the timing fit the film so well.  And watching without the distraction of dialogue made us appreciate the animation on a new intimate level.As the film came to a close we inched past midnight said our thanks and passed into a dreamless sleep.Thank you Tess for the wonderful memories and thanks to everyone who read this far.","psychedelics","1077",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Communication - 5/5 - Absolutely fantastic... this is where HoS truly stands out in my opinion. This vendor genuinely cares about their customers and is always open and communitative about everything. They responded to every question I had promptly. This is probably the most genuine vendor I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.Stealth - 5/5 - It's LOL good that's all I will say. Also like how 'protected' the LSD strips are.Shipping/Processing times - 5/5 - It was a crazy time for vendors but HoS was ontop of his game and processed the order pretty quickly. Ended up giving me free priority shipping due to a delay and the goods arrived in 3 days. Not only this but HoS also threw in two extras  Product - 5/5 - The Salvador Dali's were listed at 120ug and I'd say this is probably pretty accurate. Product did have little bit of a body load about an hour in-- I started to feel a little 'winded' and needed to sit down and chill for about 20 minutes. After that though the experience was pretty blissful. Visuals were very apparent but not overwhelming at all.. lots of morphing trees were swirling enhanced colors floor rug was almost pool-like lights with extra glowy hue etc. Nothing TOO crazy at all but super pleasant visuals. Headspace was incredibly clear... I tripped with 8 people and we were all pretty functional and conversational. Could interact with sober people and the 'real world' just fine. Euphoria was also solid-- We had a gigglefest all night long. This particular acid was also rather energetic- we had an impromptu dance party at some point and everyone was rather active/interactive. Later went into a jacuzzi in the outdoors and it felt as if we were all melting into the universe as the trees swirled back and forth... pure bliss. Next day I had a lot of profound realizations about my life when I thought about new years resolutions and etc. Felt like a million bucks (and still do). Overall the Salvador Dali's were excellent! I think it's a great acid for less experienced people or situations where you would like to be functional and interactive. Definitely good for group settings and parties. The experience was more on the mild end for me but sometimes that is exactly what you are looking for. Very tolerable and controllable experience.HoS will definitely be my go to vendor for LSD now. Prices are great Customer Service is exceptional and product was solid and just as described. Product variety is also better than anyone else I've seen. Next to come: Review of the 150ug Shivas.. probably will try them within the next few weeks.THANKS FOR AN AWESOME NEW YEARS HOUSE!","psychedelics","463",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"92",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","This review is for BlueViking's Dali print 140ug LSD tabs.A little background on me: I've dropped acid a dozen times before and taken a lot of other hallucinogens besides. I'm a little bit of hard-head and my usual sweet-spot is about 350-400ug for a fun meaningful trip.I purchased three tabs from BV before the Christmas shutdown in the midst of bitcoin instability and all kinds of drama surrounding the DDOS. In spite of all the shit going on he shipped my order within 48hrs and didn't even ask me to finalize early. The package came quickly and the stealth was extremely clever. No details but it's a technique I've seen before and it's brilliant. Way too many LSD vendors are cavalier about stealth so I haveÂ  to commend BV for taking it seriously.I took the tabs on New Year's Eve and had an amazing trip. Easily my best trip overall since my first trip. I don't get strong visuals easily but the three tabs I took gave me astoundingly present three-dimensional fractal light pattern OEVs along with lots of tracers melting and things I couldn't even endeavor to explain here. I seriously don't have words for some of what I saw. And the CEVs were even better but I didn't really have time to appreciate them since I was with people. I glimpsed vast alien landscapes behind my eyes. There was some synesthesia when I listened to music (in the form of ribbons of light that moved like blood in water). The body high was great too and other than some jaw-neck tension late in the trip pretty much no body-load.I felt sane and in control of myself the whole time but I'd say it was one of the more intense acid experiences I've had to date. Great way to ring in the new year. Thanks BlueViking!Tl","Dr: 5/5 on everything great LSD.","psychedelics",312,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Watched Across the Universe for the first time and it was almost a religious experience lol. We went outside and even in the dark with street lights dimly lighting my back yard we could still see the trees vibrating with flickering in the night sky - of which later we had a crazy bit of laughter when the end of AtU ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds"" started playing because that's EXACTLY what we saw!  Probably one of the best trips of my life and I've experienced a bit (mushrooms salvia 25b 25i mdma lsd (years ago))Second trip: Noticable difference in interpretation of music movies...nice body buzz...but no visuals. While I enjoyed it I feel that 200ug is not enough for me to be ""where I like to be"" during an LSD trip. Not that I would complain if all I could ever do was 200ug it seemed like the prior 400ug trip was much much better.Third trip (NYE): Started out watching Tommy Boy. Me and my girl fell out of our chairs laughing at the ""Fat guy little coat"" part and I don't think I've ever laughed that hard in my entire life. Side-splitting laughter for a solid half an hour over the corniest of moments in that movie. Then as the ball dropped in Tommy Boy Chris Farley danced in his little coat almost as if he was dancing to the countdown and this made us laugh all over again...after that calmed down the visuals were a teeny bit more intense than the 400ug more noticable blurring of lines and colors and simply closing my eyes my mind wandered into areas I never thought possible. I watched little mini movies made in my brain as I laid in bed listening to the Global DJ Broadcast....pretty sweet trip!All in all I really can't say how Tess's cid compares to others available on the road but dude is top notch - responds to everyone maintains a presence on the forums and stealth is A++ (not to mention the obvious providing a quality product). Per ug Tess has the cheapest around but because you have to buy 200ug per hit it seems like it's more expensive - but I don't care. Worth every penny. I also hear their MDMA is pretty nice and my next purchase of LSD and MDMA are coming straight from Tess!On a separate note is there a reason why while on LSD that any 'pressure' on your head feels unpleasant? Even when I laid down on my favorite memory foam pillow my head felt weird. I sit up pressure/irritation goes away. Is this unique to LSD?**ALSO - Tess where did your 10 hit listing go?

I received my order one week after OOTP told me it was shipped and following that I was gone for a week. Anyway I was able to test one hit after cutting the 1/4 square inch. I received a great head and body load while receiving some great visuals. Of course it was only 100ug so my trip wasn't anything spectacular - but it was certainly great for being only 100ug. My next trip will be with 200 ug in the next week and I was wondering if anyone can vouch for 200 ug of OOTP's tabs. Thanks to OOTP for this amazing trip! Incredible shipping and stealth. The only problem was the delay but that is only due to the holiday rush so there is no blame upon OOTP.5/5 vendor. Always very transparent with the customer when problems arise!The only real downside to OOTP's product is cutting our own tabs.

THIS is hell. not that afterlife ideal.. its our job (spiritual job if you want) to stop sitting around crying about the end.. its our job to fight and try to fix it.. if you want to be a simple messanger in life theres way simpler ways to get your message out; if you're just upfront and blunt you'll offend people who are scared of the truth; but if you mediate it through art people will feel a sense of importance since they figured out/interpreted half the message on their own.. there's an art to living.. after about 6 hours in; all the way until the end (and till i fell asleep last night) i really came back down to earth and was living in the understanding of comedy (one of the three mysteries of psychology (sleep religion and humor/laughter)).. i realized that the comedy i had been watching for the past several hours was simply a tragedy.. that humor (put simply) is that bittersweet feeling you get when you are astonished..the entire next day i was looking at everything as if i were a writer.. and today i feel perfectly fine again.while watching the show i felt that life was just a reproduction of a single time traveler. what if all we are is just a myriad of projections of the same time traveler?? that we're all the same person; going through different life experiences.to end this report im just going to state that im now looking for anything to read about the occult and other similar things.. i feel like im starting to believe in magic or something but hey people believe in crazier things..","psychedelics","481",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"101",NA,"instrument lsd review","I ordered a 2 tab sample of Instrument's LSD (purportedly 140ug Shivas) from Tormarket shortly before it closed. To Instrument: my apologies that I could not finalize before I received my sample and if I can I will make you whole on a future order. Thanks for the tabs and happy new year! --------------------------------------------------------Shipping/stealth: 5/5My order took a while to arrive to east coast US via first class mail. About 14 days from when he marked it ""in transit"" if I remember correctly when I placed the order. The postmark was a little smudged on the envelope and therefore not completely legible but I believe that he shipped it when he said he did. The delay was probably because of the holidays (and he warned of this potential delay beforehand) so I do not blame him. The stealth was more than on point for blotter paper. I appreciate the mylar for extra protection.--------------------------------------------------------Product: 4/5I took 1.5 of the 2 tabs yesterday. The blotters were completely tasteless and came on VERY smoothly. It felt even more clean than LSD that I bought from albionessentialols on SR1 and it is certainly the best LSD that I have ever taken! This is top quality stuff and to me it felt like genuine LSD for sure.But as far as the strength of the experience the 1.5 tabs together felt like 140-150ug to me which would put an individual tab at ~100ug. I base my estimate on several experiences with albion's 180ug Mayan calendar blotters. Based on Instrument's claims 1.5 tabs should have contained around 210ug. Accounting for uneven distribution in the half tab I took I was expecting a 1.5 tab trip to be at least of comparable strength to the 180ug calendars which were confirmed many times over to be accurately dosed.But my experience was noticably less strong than those ones which produced much stronger hallucinations as well as a more pronounced feeling of intoxication compared to my experience with Instrument's LSD where I would have to ""focus"" more on the effects to bring out the visuals. In my opinion the strength is a little overestimated.--------------------------------------------------------Trip Report: Still my trip was very enjoyable--the perfect way to spend a day off. And though it was cold and I stayed mostly indoors at one point I went for a short but beautiful walk through a nearby park. Whenever I stopped to look at anything the textures on every surface would pulse and rearrange into fractallated patterns and images. The high was very clear-headed and not overwhelming. I felt like myself (though admittedly quite intoxicated) and was able to interact with sober friends (""muggles"") and even to help them with some menial tasks.The peak lasted about 4 hours and then toned down a bit. I spent a good part of it listening to the Butthole Surfers' Locust Abortion Technician which led me to some experimental stuff by John Frusciante (check out Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt...a very emotionally charged and beautiful work). Leave it to LSD to allow me to look past my distaste for RHCP... These were both EXTREMELY interesting to listen to while under the influence (try it and see what I mean). I'd recommend Johnny Depp and Gibby Haynes' 1993 documentary ""Stuff"" as well.Smoking some marijuana while coming down brought back stronger visuals at times stronger even then when I was peaking earlier in the trip. I got intense pareidolia for a full 13 hours until I went to sleep as I always do with LSD (it almost feels like a trademark of LSD at this point). By hour 10 or so it was about the only lingering effect. I took the tabs around 2pm and was still feeling effects when struggling to go to sleep around 4am. Why is it that no matter how early in the day I take LSD I can never easily go to sleep at night?? I took like ten goddamn melatonin tablets and still felt wired! Worthy of note is that I did not feel any fatigue or ""fried"" feeling in the brain as I have with most other LSD I've taken. I was extremely impressed by this as I had developed something of an aversion to LSD due to the ""hangover"" afterwards as well as a strange amount of sinus congestion that I almost invariably get (a weird thick mucus that hurts and takes forever to loosen--anyone else get this?? or should I get checked out for cystic fibrosis or something...).Finally I got to sleep. Despite having only slept about 3.5 hours I woke up feeling great and ready for work where I am now writing a trip report --------------------------------------------------------TL;DR -- Ordered 2 tab LSD sample from Instrument. Stealth and shipping were both excellent. LSD quality is EXCELLENT--the best I have ever had! Better than albionessentialols IMO. BUT to me the tabs feel weaker than claimed. My estimate is ~100ug compared to the 140ug in the listing. Still it was awesome. Thank you for the great LSD Instrument! Clearly your source produces some of the best LSD in the world right now.

They had just a little bit of bitterness to them but not very noticeable. It didn't take long for me to start to get very good energy (15-30) it didn't get me to jittery like some Lucy can make me early on very nice start. about an hour in I laid back on my bed with the black light on and started watching Christmas Vacation(Awesome movie!) I felt so relaxed and couldn't quit smiling from start to finish. I started getting some subtle visuals around 90mins in not a lot but still nice. A very warm relaxing and contemplative trip I was still able to be social without feeling to awkward and could still function doing my day to day stuff if I wanted. Peaked around hours 3-6 with a slow and easy come down. No noticeable Body load which was also nice! Overall very clean and sociable LCD!

"105",NA,"gfn product review thread (mdma lsd mda shrooms foxy and more?)","REVIEW ""goodfornothing"" 5/5Substance: MDA (10 grams)Delivery: It took GFN about 3 days after placing an order to actually ship the product. Personally I don't think its unreasonable that vendors have other things going on and don't ship immediately. Quantity: 11636 mg were received. That is 1.636 grams over-weight. Awesome. Not including ~80mg stuck to the inside of the bag which could be recovered for a dosage using vodka or such.Quality: Product consists 90% of large rocky crystals - very little powder is present. This reminds me of purchasing MDMA several years ago and the product was always insanely powerful and clean when encountered in this form. Crystals taste very bitter and similar flavour to MDA encountered previously.Reagents: Mecke & Marquis reagents indicate MDxx Simons Reagent doesn't react which indicated MDA. I'm almost absolutely positive that the substance in question is incredibly pure & potent MDA. Absolutely gorgeous. Big crystals are a little more difficult to work with - sure - but its a nice gesture towards the customer to display purity in such a no-nonsense fashion. Crush one up and you've got yourself MDA powder!!Overall: I'm very happy that I decided against purchasing from DrMDA; saving my BTC for GFN. MDA isn't SUPPOSED to be brown - no matter what anyone says. Yes VERY PURE MDA can be brownish but white is the natural color. I'm absolutely stoked to consume this MDA!Thanks GFNPS - trip report probably won't be anytime soonish but curiosity may fell a cat or something","psychedelics","249",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I was impressed by Bluevikings method very inconspicious.I have to commend BlueViking for his products they are absolutely top shelf.My first experience with his L was with the dalai lama i have only experienced potent LSD once prior 2 years ago.It was nothing like my first trip but that's prolly a good thing because I was blasted into space.So dropped 1hit with an ol' pal and a few hoes he fuck wit' He dropped a couple altoids with cid secured from a local source that were supposedly strong with at least a 4 week tolerance.I was wondering if anything was even on the blot because there was virtualy no taste I guess it must be real pure.We was all kickin it havin a good time u kno partyin' n bullshitin' i felt the come up real strong about 45-60 minutes in so i cracked a 4tay of sum mickey's washed her down to make sure it doesnt get too out of control riding up to the peak I experienced the most vivid and complex fractals in my entire life I've witnessed them before but nothing like that.The entire trip was a wild ride that lasted for while but I picked up a lot of ""bad vibes"" from buddy just simply because the lifestyle he lives and the way he abuses his drugs.He gave me a real weird look when both realized were tripping like he was looking down upon me because the chemical was affecting my perception so much. I think his acid was just bunk and the 1 dahli had blew away his 3 altoids that supposedly some good shit.My cognition was impaired signifigantly at a certain point it got me questioning how inteligent i really i am there was this chick trying to talk to me but i couldn't even formulate a sentence so she decided i must be fryin so she starts to try and trip me out constantly not in an anoying way cuzz been thru it herself. She wasn' trippin at all that night but she seemed like to the that can pick up ""contact highs"" ""vibes"". Mid trip he decides to lure his hoes into his bedroom with the sum of the most mindless treatment of women of i've ever seen invites me for an orgy and he knows im not into that type of shit because I got a woman right now and i don't fuck wit' woman i dont get to know.Â He left the room covered in filth absolutely disrespecting me puttin his hands on me an' shit i would elbowed up right then n thre but i didnt hav newhere else 2 crash in the night and it was 3-4 in the morning prolly -20 below out so i held it all in the he gets down on knees holding his head like its gonna pop seemed like he was in a real stressful trip and looks up 2 me like he needs advice and I didn't what fuck to tell him so. Besides remain peaceful as i could be in such a moment and try to share that vibe rolled one up.I was absolutely impressed by the power of one hit of the substance LSD and it helped me reinforce my belief in the kundali Chakras specifally the Third Eye and the Crown.2CB opened me up to the importance of the Roots Naval and glimpses of the third eye and crown.I couldn't act or behave in a manor that felt like myself i am familar with ego loss but not like that and it was strangest damn thing it made me act and feel like a child and i had a real hard to resisting it i didn't let it pull me into a bad trip but it really made me think about who i am what the drug does to my brain.I boosted later in the night with roughly 15mg in shot of cogniac I went from post peak platuao on L to being blasted into and experienced the hivemind of man I absolutely love nexus. It is definately pure because I let friends sample 5-15 mg doses and it was active.Trial 2 with L was home alone and I experienced astral travel saw the most intricate and complex world in my mind it seemed so real and then waves of reality that left me into a bit of the insanity the L can unleash on you. Overall I love LSD and Nexus and can't wait to experience higher doses.I definately plan on doing future business I would highly recommend Blue Viking he runs a near impeccable service.From the bottom of my heart thank you everyone that contributes to these market places and does there best to keep these operations the way the should be.

"110",NA,"akid lsd trip report","Ive only taken LSD once before ordering from Akid he even gave me a freebie so thanks for that.First time I took LSD (Years ago) I took a ""microdot"" - I felt very little from my first experience  colours were slightly brighter than usual but that was all - so my expectations this time weren't THAT great I presumed LSD was not the powerful drug that YouTube videos assured me it was - I was wrong.So I ordered from Akid - it was very cheap and he gave me a generous freebie as mentioned.  I had 5 in total and took half of one to begin with.  30 mins went by and I felt similar feelings to my first experience as I presumed I needed more I underestimated them and ended up taking 3 in total over a 2 hour period.  I still felt very little.  I went to bed early at around 9.30.I put my electric blanket on for 5 mins and switched the lights off presuming I was off to bed for the night and the mild trip was over.I switched my electric blanket off but I felt that it was still heating me infact it was hotter than ever so I double checked. But it was off.I couldn't sleep so I put my light back on.At this point I said to my wife ""I'm starting to trip"".  I began to feel like a spectator on my own life.  When my wife spoke to me it was like I was watching me and her speak together. Simple tasks felt very complicated.  I became slightly uneasy but my wife talked me down - I felt like I had a microscope and was looking at life through this microscope - I could see very clearly why people did things their motives.Tasks were complicated because I looked at everything so much in detail.I wanted to get a glass of water from the bathroom next door I asked my wife to get it me because I didnt know if I would over complicate it in my head.I felt separated from my ego.It was a journey I was not in control of.I felt like I was being aloud to see things other people usually are not privy to.No hallucinations yet - but then I look at my light.I notice that it is reflecting a mild purple colour I comment to my wife that its pretty thinking she can see it she says "" what colours ?""  and immediately I click.  Im hallucinating.The lamp starts emitting beautiful purple and red and blue.  The lamp is in the corner of my bedroom.  Most of my visual hallucinations are in this part of the room.  I tend not to hallucinate TOO much when I look at things except in the ""lamp corner"".The colours form lines which ""criss-cross"" with each other then melt away sometimes totally away sometimes just fading into something else.The wallpaper witch has no design starts having beautiful mild patterns on it witch start moving in waves the waves form more patterns.The light from the lamp morphs from a bright red into a VERY bright white light that fills the whole room at witch point I become uneasy as I start thinking about seeing light when you die.  The light diminishes and returns to a red glow that is localized around the lamp again.My bedroom is absolutely fireworks.  Melting and morphing with smokey colours.I can feel the colour - when I breath the patterns change.  What I see is connected to my emotions.There is a video on YouTube called ""30 hits of LSD"" The guy took 30 and wondered if he would ever NOT be high again and I remembered that and I wondered if I would always be high as this was now 2.00am - I took my first LSD at 5.30pm the night before.I switched the light off to reduce my visual stimulation witch worked. I no longer hallucinated so much.  but the light shinning through my curtains made patterns witch rippled up and down.The clock (green l.e.d) numbers moved in beautiful ways when I closed my eyes I saw small patterns that were repeated hundreds/thousands of times over.Over all I felt that the trip had detached me from myself from my own ego.  Broken me down as to who I thought I was  let me examine the world in great (almost infinitesimal) detail - showed me another world (both spiritually and visually) that I would never have seen and towards the end of the trip rebuilt me and reattached me to myself/ego.  The trip was not something I was in control of I was taken on a journey and it felt like I was being allowed to see what the trip wanted me to see.An absolutely amazing trip way beyond my expectations and more powerful than any other drug Ive taken before and Ive taken quite a lot. What an amazing experience.Would highly recommend Akid.","psychedelics","826",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"112",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Haha I'll hold off on the MDA. http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/80283-MDAWhat kind of negative effects can I get from MDA?Well you can die. No I’m not joking. MDxx drugs are considered to be relatively safe but if you take them irresponsibly then the risk of death or serious bodily harm are increased greatly. MDA is a stimulant. Heart rate blood pressure etc all increase. If you have any type of preexisting cardiac condition this could be fatal to you. It is possible that those with CYP2D6 enzyme deficiency may be more susceptible to MDxx overdoses as that enzyme is thought to play a role in metabolizing MDA. This is not certain however. There is serotonin syndrome a condition where the high levels of serotonin released by MDA can cause hyperthermia (over heating) seizures and death. The more benign side effects include a panic reaction (bad trips happen even on these drugs) jaw clenching high body temperature muscle aches from overexertion and dehydration (though this can become fatal if not careful).What about neurotoxicity? Is MDA more damaging than MDMA?I wish I could give an answer to this but it just isn't known. MDMA hasn’t been proven to be neurotoxic at recreational levels thought I would assume that it is to some degree. I would also venture that MDA is more toxic than MDMA.One method of neurotoxicity is the dopamine theory. It works like this: MDA enters the brain causing the release of serotonin dopamine etc. As the 5ht system is much slower than the DA system in replenishing itself the serotonin runs low. Now you are left with a high level of dopamine which may get picked up by the 5ht receptors. As dopamine isn’t designed to ""fit"" in those receptors this can damage them. It is unknown the extent of this damage or what effects this might have. Seeing as how MDA is a more potent releaser of dopamine than MDMA is I would venture to say that it is more neurotoxic.Note: Another method of neurotoxicity could be from toxic metabolites of MDA. Both the dopamine theory and the toxic metabolite theory have supporters. It is entirely possible that one both or neither of these theories is correct. Now many things are neurotoxic alcohol for one. Even if it is shown that recreational use of MDxx is toxic then we still must look at three things: how toxic to what sites and is the damage permanent. As MDA was used extensively in the 1960’s and 70’s I am doubtful of it being extremely dangerous but you never know. Time will tell on this issue.","psychedelics","431",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am very excited to try it out and I'll post a trip report once I do but I wanted to leave a review of the transaction while it is still fresh on my mind. Communication: 5/5Tess responded to all my messages - before and after I ordered - within less than a day. He was very professional throughout. After the order shipped he sent me a message telling me what I could expect. I was a little worried about recognizing the damn package after all the stories I have heard about his stealth so I sent him a message with my PGP key and he told me what to expect. AND Tess has a great forum presense so you can kind of get a feel for his personality here. Couldn't ask for anything else as far as communication goes. Shipping: 4/5It was coming from one coast of Canada to the other coast of the US and took 11 days. I have absolutely no right to bitch especially since that is well within Tess' projected timeframe. But you guys know how painful it is to wait for a package you are excited for.  Stealth: 5/5I can't say too much but it definitely gave me a smile. If I were a customs agent and opened the letter I'd just shrug it off. I'm glad I asked about the stealth ahead of time or I might have thrown it away/not found my LSD. I passed it to a few friends with a shit eating grin saying ""Hey. There is LSD in this envolope."" and it took 30 seconds even knowing that it was there to find it.Â  Product: later/5I'll post a trip report when I get around to taking some. Damn ""job"" and ""being a contributing member to society"". The tabs are about quarter inch squares. Got the number I ordered. It is non-perforated with handdrawn lines. Psycologically the ""homemade"" feel is slightly offputting but I know that you can have fancy blotter sheets with shit on it and cheap sheets with high quality stuff on it. And knowing Tess it will be high quality stuff. Overall: 5/5I trust Tess have a few friends who have had luck with him on SR1 and now have had success myself.

I must admit that I didn't realise until after I ordered that this wasn't from Hinguel's usual supplier. I almost certainly would have held off for a week had I know BUT that is not to say the stuff that arrived isn't good. I'm just on a mission to locate the best charlie supplier on SR so would have preferred to try the usual stuff.Stealth was great and more than adequate for domestic or international delivery. Comms have been excellent - I felt like I had a customer support team on hand at all times which is pretty damn awesome all things considered. From a vendor point of view Hiniguel is definitely up there in my top two (Technohippy being the other)Weight was a little under - Mine came in at 0.96g. Not anything to bother me although most of the coke orders I have received from other vendors have been slightly over. Just something to consider Hiniguel.Product smells very nice has a lovely fishscale sheen to it and produces a good numbing effect (although not too much which is good as I always suspect a cut if the numbing effect is too pronounced). The order was a mix of powder and small rocks and these dissolve nicely to an oily residue if rubbed between fingers. It looks almost identical to the fishscale sold by Subtickle if anyone has tried that - in fact I have a little of that left and I can't tell the two apart.I don't plan to use this for a few days so can't comment on the high yet. I'd be very surprised if it is not as good if not better that the other vendors I have tried on SR. I'd be very interested to hear what this is like in comparison to the usual Hiniguel batches from someone that has tried both.","psychedelics","316",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Never forget set/setting/outside influences can have positive or negative effects on your trip (local news for instance) Zero taste.The come up was all but non existent yet after 3+ hrs you were still getting deeper. Very apparent OEV's & the classic audio perception we all love the CEV's were distant perhaps because it was hard to keep your eyes shut.Around  4 hrs in both me & my trip partner experienced some stomach discomfort i am not really sure if it was the crystal  or the 'clenching' of our stomachs being so high (much like meth users grind teeth) but it was apparent. This LSD (*for me) could take me as far down the rabbit hole as i wanted with my thoughts & when i laid down my body several times floated along yet at the same time tripping deep i felt as if i could talk to anyone - it was both very clear headed & psychedelic giving it a very nice head & body high  To be honest to be truly objective I will have to try this LSD again. I will tell you its clear/clean & very potent.  Around 8.5hrs in i fell asleep only to wake up 2 hrs latter still tripping very nicely (wonder what I dreamed) I then smoked dank till i was ready to crash while enjoying my visualizer & Grateful Dead collection.

It was my first order with HoS and after some message exchanges I was comfortable enough to FE for free shipping. HoS has excellent product knowledge. Communication was stellar. I appreciated the updates from order to delivery. Shipped Tuesday received Saturday in the US. The packaging's stealth was incredible. More importantly however HoS made himself available for any questions or concerns and made the entire process easy. I did it with my girlfriend with a therapeutic intent for her (inspired by the works of Stanislov Grof James Fadiman maps.org etc) so lots of planning for set and setting were made. It was her first time on LSD. Her only other drug experience was MDMA with me which she loved. I have experience with low to medium doses of LSD shrooms and mescaline. I gave her roughly 225ug (I meant to give her 150ug thinking the tabs were 100ug!). I took roughly 75ug to be just above threshold and still be grounded to sit and guide if she goes through difficult periods.

The laying came out a bit uneven which means that some hits will be weak and other will be very strong. Regardless of the dosage the quality is top notch.This product is being sold for a limited time at significantly reduced prices(starting at $7 a hit). We have tasted several random hits and find that they fall between 120-180ug.For this who prefer a higher level of quality control our 200ug white label will remain available. This white label will continue to be an evenly laid 200ug per hit.For those who prefer to get a better price and a less consistant product we will have this art blotter available for the next few week. This is the same LSD on different paper.","psychedelics","156",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a three stage wash of acetone ether and then water which can filter out some impurities whist cocaine dissolves 100% in water and once its evaporated you scrape up the powder.I expect this will make it a lot better but the same can be said for any coke here. The coke in my area is sold by peope who think having a numb face and blocked nose is a cocaine high -this was far better than street coke for sure.I will report back on what its like when washed. I guess this intensive wash will see 20-30% loss but its really a gain as whatever was washed out is not cocaine. You will find this even with the best coke ever. If you wash cocaine and have no loss it means someone is adding cuts to the imported briicks. A lot of bricks are broken up cuts added then its rebricked. Neither acetone ether or water can capture some cuts. Even so I've never had a decent coke that was not way better when washed.One other point often as not the reformed brick is not homogenous - its not an even mix so you can get differing purity throughout. I slept ok after using so all well there.Look forward to Hiniguel restocking from the usual source.Â ","psychedelics","268",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I have bought from Tessellated three times back from the SR1 days and I hope to get another order in here when my next payday rolls around. I have to SING Tessellated's praises his tabs are the most amazing/life changing you will ever come across. I have personally tripped 5 times from Tess's gear with doses between 1-2 hits at various times and I have to say they are POWERFULL. The most recent time I tripped (about two months ago) I experienced full ego loss and total loss of reality for a few moments during the peak where I experienced a flash of the ""clear light"" and it was the most beautiful thing I have every expereinced. I experienced this powerful experience off of only TWO tabs!! After I get some $$$ for another order from Tess here soon I am gonna go up to 3 or 4 tabs I think to see if I can get to the light again and actually stay there for awhile. If you're on the fence about Tess's tabs you need to just buy 'em and take two and experience some magic! :-) Thank you for providing such beautful LSD man!!! :-)","psychedelics","230",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Whilst some might mourn the loss of 200mg of 'coke' the reality is that you will need less of the washed yayo for your night out. I once lost amost 90% off some UK vendor that coke contained speed (chlorine test = drop a small bit of coke into some chlorine and if you see a red streak its likely amphetamine)Just to add - there was no speed in Hiniguels and its rare to find someone silly enough to add speed as a cut on SR. In RL we are seeing RCs dumped into the 'coke'. Washing coke means a cleaner product and your nose will thank you. Best get back to work then oh look its almost 5.00pm. Tools down. Rolls joint to have a sy toke outside with the guys. Got a lift home no way am I smoking a joint of the UKs finest bud in a car!

"124",NA,"**hiniguel uk review thread** pure meth peruvian cola - bulk dutch mdma +  lsd!","Hi Hiniguel - just to report that I ended up washing the yayo - it was a real intensive wash using acetone ether and water - not all together!I start off by using acetone anhydrous (with no water in there) and that gets a few cuts of the mix.The coke is put into a lab filter into a smal funnel and acetone poured over it. Then the filter is pressed to absorb what acetone is left there its dried on a radiator and that leaves what looks ike cocaine off the block.The coke is then crushed up best to put the coke in a bowl and use a teasppoon to crush it up to a fine powder. Then its the ether. Coke dissolves in ether other things don't. The coke is put in a filter and the ether dissolves the coke. It then has to be evaporated simply using a bowl and radiator. Then scrape up the coke when the ether is evaporated you need to use a razor as the coke sticks to the bowl. You will see a layer of what looks like glass. Scrape it all up!Then its a simple water wash. I use distilled water. 10ml or so dissolved the powder and dripped through the filter. I added another few m to get whatever was on the filter. Some residue was left in the filter so I'm glad I used water also.An overnight dry and the result looks like nothing! The coke is almost see through until you scrape it up with a razor. Then we see the coke looking the colour of pearl! It will dry out quite quickly but at first its gloopy and wet.The result was a coke that was up there with the best! The loss was a bit higher than I'd iike but I've seen worse. You cannot make a bad coke better via washing. I tried two tiny kiddy lines smooth as silk and euphoric with no urge to bang more ten minutes later.So although I lost a bit of volume - what I have is so good that 100mg would be more than enough for me. Its on a par with the Sukey UCC (uttra clean coke) you cannot feel it going up.Â  I was surpised at how good it was after the wash. Most coke ought to be washed IMO - but few people seem willing to pay the price for it when vendors do offer it. Few customers wash coke shame really as those really nice cokes you get - when washed are fantastic.Anyhow thought I'd let you know. The coke I have now is one that I'm more than happy with.Â  Wish I had more of it but got more on the way for a big party next week!Â  I do love a party.I'm sure the usual batch of Peruvian would not lose as much in a wash so I look forward to that.Comms from Hiniguel are excellent also.

Next dose was 16 mg and just lovely.I'm eager to keep exploring this stuff and upping the dose slightly. I'm curious how often others use 2C-B or for those who've learn by trial and error how often is too often? I've read up on the stuff but it's still not real clear to me.

I could hear every individual cricket clearly every sound really as if my hearing had been heightened.  I felt like I was just melting into the hammock my body was so relaxed.  My imagination was running wild and I would lay there and chuckle to myself at funny thoughts.  Suddenly everything makes this grouch laugh alot more.  My dogs that were already adorable grew even more adorable faces so it was nice having them around during the trip.  The little one took advantage of my elevated state and layed with me on the hammock.  Overall no bad trip no bad experience at all!  I've tried my best to convey how much of a good time I had on his product.  I did notice that I experienced significantly less nausea with the chocolates than I would eating dried cubes.  The taste of the product  was very pleasant you could not taste the cubes at all. The overall experience lasted about 3 hours.I highly recommend this vendor and his chill-pills.","psychedelics","450",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I figured it couldn't be that bad but obviously I massively underestimated the power of it.I'm just posting my experince so others can get to know it don't drop 300µg right away visuals are excellent but that bad feeling was incredibly strong. Again as long as you don't worry about it you can ride it out so its not too bad but I really wouldn't recommend the dose. I wouldn't call the time after the peak enjoyable. Cannabis was done well after the visuals had stopped though I'm not sure how long in they stopped. After smoking the cannabis I did notice they slightly picked up again I had a strange mist coming off of me but nobody else.If anyone is looking to try it for the first time I'd say do 100µg and see how you feel I payed the price for being stupid.I tried it again with roughly 75µg as I cut a tab in half I got no visuals at all but I did had a great feeling constantly.

I swear this was a small almost out one and it mesmerized me it was sooo beautiful the smell of the type of wood i was burning Im in the south so we have beautiful trees an smell great when burning and even hearing the crackles of the fire were just in a way peaceful to me.. So i guess 10 min after being stuck to looking at it I built it back up Well as it grew bigger it just amazed the shit out of me!!! I stayed at home as most of you are guessing im not into shrooming and being around public looking like a moron I have a reputation in my Community to protect so NO way could i do that.  So Even with the fire Big as i could get it I was freezing So i go put on a thermal coat etc and grab a thick ass blanket well as i was peaking i guess by this point It was just all soo peaceful and a wonderful feeling of being one with the Universe is best i can say. But I noticed when i put the Blanket over me It almost felt like it started to melt to me in a way or move its hard to explainthen the fire looked like it was taking on shapes of faces Kinda got scary for a few secs but i shook it off and just continued to lay back for another Hour and watch everything around me I decided to do one thing before it finally started coming down and that was to hope on my Motorcycle and take a ride into town where all the lights were MAN I WAS PROBABLE GOING 20 through town and suppose to be going 35 just looking and watching all the restaurants signs stop lights etc  Then i got nervous coppers would fuck with me so i Hauled ass home BTW GO 70 ON a motorcycle on mushrooms its fucking great!!!

Now this is where shit gets really cool this road was about 100 meters long but took us a good half an hour to get down. We'd take a few steps notice something then all burst out laughing at it. Still not much in the way of visuals until I stared at the road and it started to move in and out breathing. I called the others over and they stared too not seeing anything at first but then it suddenly moved. Anyway about half an hour later we made it to the shops and this was the single most intense thing of my life. EVERYTHING WAS FUCKED! Like seriously I'd look at the shelf and this cunt is all over the place melting chaning colour! Absolutely amazing!! I got two cans of god knows what and went to pay but I couldn't do it right because I started to laugh uncontrollably as V lost his shit and ran out of the shop laughing his head off (later when we sobered up we realised he took some stuff without paying but not intentionally) Anyway we left the shop. C started to properly come up but got *very* paranoid he was convinced everyone was looking at him no matter what me or V said so we decided to head home. The way home is down a slight hill then a long flat road to my house. But we are on acid so this definately wasn't what it was like. I kid you not the whole world was moving up and down infront of me the road would turn into a 15ft hill and I'd have to physically drag myself up it (and this was once a totally flat surface) once I got past that another one formed just waves and waves of never ending tarmac.Once we got back C took another tab so he had 300Âľg too. The visuals just kept getting stronger and stronger everything was fucked and I mean everything no matter what I looked at it melted changed everything. God I get so pumped just remembering this it was truly the best experince of my life. Anyway all this was about to change it seemed... we managed to buy some cannabis of a local dealer who delivers to me though I have absolutely no recollection of buying it or anything. To me I was sitting at the table in the dining room wondering about cannabis then suddenly we walked back in through the door and had it. We all turned to each other and asked one another how we got it none of us knew.So we spent literally an hour rolling one joint and lit it... now cannabis goes well with acid. And I mean excellent you get that lovely cannabis buzz and feel warm and fuzzy. We only like strong sativas though and this was our downfall. My mind started going apeshit thinking about exsistance and who I was and everything. This is not something I'd recommend thinking about on acid I know people say it is spiritual but fuck it I was in for the *worst experiance of my life* I seriously wanted to die at a point that night. Basically I had some pulls offÂ  the joint passed it along. Then I looked at C and V.... who were these guys? Where the fuck am I? Who am I? Who is thinking this? Why am I thinking? What are we doing here? It went on like this for about five or six hours. I felt I had gone utterly insane I was frightend I was terrified. I was convinced I had broken my mind and I had literally gone insane and there was no going back. Thankfully C didn't get this though V did too C kept reminding us we had taken acid and we'd be back to normal. The way we feel is a bad trip (as none of us had done acid before we weren't sure what a bad trip was though we had an idea about how to deal with it) and eventually I managed to feel a bit better. Instead of being worried about the bad trip I laughed it off I felt insane didn't know who I was but I just thought well its funny that I've actually gone insane so why not enjoy it.From 11AM till 5AM we didn't sober up. If we had stayed awake I am certain we would have been high for well over 24 hours I went to sleep still tripping out of my mind.Anyway I know my review is a load of shit but honestly I lost my fucking mind man....Buy aKids stuff but go easy it really is the shit I cannot begin to explain what this stuff is like... Just so unbelievably intense you lose all sense of what reality is start thinking the whole world is made up by you. You lose your mind but you learn to love it and its fucking fantastic.If you're going to take 300ug (even 150ug is strong another friend tried one tab and forgot who I was for about 8 hours no matter what anyone said) just remember that you've taken it with the intention of losing your mind because for the next 24 hours you will be in a land of chaos and insanity but one of wonder and delight too. I don't think I'll be doing it again though I took half a tab and had nothing but happy thoughts and an excellent trip however I saw no visuals whatsoever. If you're looking to feel good I'd say take half a tab and see how it goes. If it didn't do enough try another half. You can try a little and feel nothing or you can try a lot and hate it. BE PAITENT let the drug take hold it takes about two hours to properly peak.","psychedelics","1249",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"137",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","my review for the Ohm Shiva's took 1 of these babies VERY strong stuff. Very spiritually profound experience. Few open eyed visuals but when when they did occur they were very... alien. I could vaguely see through the veil into some other spriritual reality where I could make out what seemed to be spiritual entities moving about. Extreme closed eye visuals of different sorts.. at times angelic warping/meshing geometric fractalyn patterns twisting and splashing and bubbling with neon emenating colors sometimes closely resembling DMT (some dmt must have been released up in there).. at times the visions were disturbingly demonic and violent and at other times just straight up alien.1 hit was overkill for my hypersensitive mind but i wouldn't take it back it was necessary to reveal the preconscious garbage that i have to work through release and calm in my everyday meditations. the day after the trip i felt refreshed spiritually rejuvinated and blissed out. next time 1/4-1/2 hit will be enough to bring about the perfect sized psychedelic waves.overall 5/5.  the stealth packing made me giggle.  friendly communication.  I will be back for more thanks HoS ! ","psychedelics","190",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"138",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Okay I had to post this some may hate Me Some may not.. I had been searching for about three an half weeks for a US domestic Vendor with some fair Lucy prices. I messaged The Top Three in my opinion based on consumer reviews and vendor poilicies. BV you were one i messaged broas well as Inanna& HouseOfSpirit. Now i was asking question about a possible 25 unit custom package pretty much same question to all three vendors. Inanna answered quickest but was unable to offer in escrow at the time. Now House emailed me back & aksed for specifics and then never emailed again.I never got any response from BlueViking about anything. No i would guess you are a busy man or woman so i chalk that up to side effect of being busy. I kept looking and finally after realizing that all the domestic suppliers had No Good Bulk Price Listings. I decided after getting the shaft from my own Countrymen i would look to others overseas for more effective price schematics. I emailed JC once and he emailed me back within a few 48 hours and Had No Issues With My Custom Order. I would have liked to spread some coin around to the locals in my neck of the woods but the locals ignored me..... I am soo Saaad. i would have liked to be one of your First Victims BV....lol I just have been in buisness man for so long that i still apply the one rules that has never failed me Ask if they cannot or will not then go somehwere else to someone else who can make it happen.... So i am not nocking any vendor here just letting you all know how i was treated and my experiences so far. I am looking forward to your new Road Prints That Sir is a legendary Idea.

"139",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Stopping in to make an in depth vendor review and trip report.VendorIncredible stealth! I was laughing my ass off about how amazing the packaging was seriously A+++The shipping speed was just as impressive. I think it was only 3 days for me to get my product from the time that I ordered it. This alone makes this vendor invaluable to me and I will continue to buy his products.LSD Review/Trip ReportI'm new to the world of LSD but not to tripping. I have smoked DMT and brewed up my own very potent Ayahuasca and have taken it dozens of times I'm mention this because it's directly relevant to my trip with BV's LSD. The last time I did Aya it was an analogue using Acacia and I had ordered the materials from a different vendor this last time. When I got the rook bark I noticed that it looked weird to me (like a different part of the tree or something) but I went ahead and boiled it up anyways. The liquid itself looked very similar to what it normally did once I finished making it (it has a very unique color) so I felt comfortable with it and went ahead and dosed myself. I was stupid and decided to take a heroic dose from this new batch I just made and also smoke some death pot (by itself it had some ego death/dark qualities to it) while I was still coming up on the Aya. While my work with Aya in the past had been very heavenly I had my shit coming to me this time. A freak thunderstorm rolled in on what was a beautiful sun shining day and absolute horror fell on me (I don't think this was directly tied to the storm but it certainly added to the atmosphere of it). It was like Hell opened up and took over my house and it's surroundings completely. I felt like I had really fucked up and I was eternally damned in this state of suffering. The feeling was one of literally being in a demonic horror film filled with the dark side of witchcraft and the occult. I tried to fight it with music singing and dancing but it just became too overwhelming...I ended up freaking out and screaming. I was sure I overdid it and that today was the day of my death. People talk about beautiful ego death experiences (I've had those plenty of times) but this wasn't one of them. Good thing I was home alone as a sitter would have flipped out as well. This experience left me traumatized for several months both physically and mentally though I already had some issues in the background that factored into this (I had been smoking pot everyday for a good 7 months before this and it had already had some pretty big effects on me mentally i REALLY needed a break). This experience was humbling in literally the worst kind of way but there are some positives to it. My addiction (I don't use this word often but in my particular case it was effecting my health) to pot was literally broken in a day. I didn't smoke for 5 months then another month after that. I did end up going through some serious clinical depression (I was seeing the first symptoms of this before this trip with Aya. Some drug related but a lot of it was just shit that happened in my life the preceding months) throughout those next few months and it was an awful process of recovery for my brain chemistry. I'm proud to say that today I absolutely love life with or without substances and am happier than I've probably every been my entire life. Everyday is glowing for me.Ok so now that the prologue is finished. Onto LSD and Blue Viking.So 7 months later I'm finally ready to start tripping again. I ordered some LSD from another vendor and took 150ug for my first time experience. It was an absolutely incredible experience of euphoria and spirituality for me but I knew I wanted it more intense.I ended up buying 3 tabs of the 185ug from Blue Viking. 2 weeks after my last trip with LSD I ended up splitting the tabs with a friend making the dose around 272ugs. His LSD is real and very potent. This was an overwhelming trip for both us. It had a polarity to it it was a trip of both Light and Dark and I was left in marvel. The peak was a bit frightening as I was basically hyperventillating at one point and breathing hard (damn cigarettes that I've been smoking plus I was just recovering from being a bit sick with flem). A bit of that Dark shade from the Aya trip opened up however I felt like I was able to walk through it and manage it and I felt a lot of internal development of just being able to embrace the trauma I went through. This is hard to explain but there was also an awe at the Divine Light the mystery of life and the enjoyment of being alive. We were able to watch an incredible sunset over a lake just after the peak of the LSD and it had such an emanation of immortality and bliss with deep conversation of philosophy time and energy. I was ready to stay in that state forever. I must say that the 272ug was a bit too much for me it was less euphoric and more just fucking intense (I don't know how else to say it). I'll probably take 225 mics next time and build back up from there.So we end up leaving the park we were at pick up some food and head back to my friend's place. I decided to eat 2 THC gummies from the vendor RosesGarden at this time (amazing product I highly recommend). So by the time we make it to his house the thc is just starting to kick in and is having a synergistic effect with the Lucy. We get there and my friend's grandpa is home living there as well. I go ahead and eat and end up sitting on the couch watching a movie called the Green Mile with my friend and his grandpa. The THC is hitting me hard and it becomes revealed to me that in this moment my friend's Grandpa is being an incarnated channel of God to me. I suspect that he didn't know about this and I was just in a trance but during this part of the trip our conversation was pretty clear. I was getting some guidance and advice on the direction that I want to take in life. He said some things that really helped me in what to do in fixing some broken relationships with a group of really good friends.Â  He mentioned eternity and my mind was being blown away as time was illuminated and it's expansion was very lengthy at the time. There was this glow in the room and in my peripheral I would see God sitting in the room with us as a person's silhouette in the form of Light but He would talk through my friend's grandpa. I took notes and there was a lot of cool synchronicity happening. There was such a divine glow over all of us and the spiritual connection was ineffable.After I left there I ended up meeting with another friend to go to a local club that plays awesome Trance/House/Progressive/etc music. I took another gummy and ended up dancing the night away. This was the least intense part of the day yet amazing none the less.So overall I felt like my day went like this: The LSD peak was very much like a rebirth the conversation with God was beautiful communion and planning on what to do with my new life and the Rave was like a celebration of this new season of my life. And that's what entheogens will do for you kids! LMAO!With all of that said my advice is to hold the upmost respect for these substance (pot included) or you will get burned","if you build your relationship with the substance and take it slow you'll find a reality so wonderful and glorious you'll be wondering why everyone doesn't just enjoy Heaven on Earth. Start low and build up taking breaks from the substances adds to their beauty and your own stability. And to get back to the thread topic Blue Viking is an incredible vendor and I have already put in another order with him.I hope you found my post at least a little bit entertaining and possibly even a bit educational.~Peace!","psychedelics",1455,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"140",NA,"haizenberg mdma + lsd review","Hi everyone ColoradoDreamer here leaving a brand new review thread for Haizenberg's MDMA and LSD. This will be a combined review for both products.Communication/Professionalism: 10/10: Haizenberg was very quick in replying to private messages very straightforward and answered any questions properly. Not much to say in this department everything went smoothly and there wasn't much need for communication.Shipping/Stealth: 7/10: I wouldn't really blame Haizenberg but my letter took about 3 weeks to get to the East Coast US. I ordered RIGHT after the holiday break so a lottttt of packages were still in the mail system and slowing a lot of things down. He's also in eastern EU which is thousands of miles away... I'd assume it would take at least over a week to get to the US and then combined with the fact that it's international and I ordered during the holidays. I had no problem waiting for my package to arrive. Stealth was alright did not use MBB and was ordered international I would feel more comfortable if MBB was used in the future. Still didn't really care much since it was only a small personal amount.Product/Quality: 10/10: Very nice light tan MDMA powder just barely a bit sticky. Some nice crystals I could see in the powder though clear-ish brown. When I opened the baggie there was a slight sassy black licorice smell. That really puts me at ease cause I feel like any legit mdma has to have that smell. I could be wrong but it just warms me up inside when I smell that (albeit gross) black licorice so reassuring.Â  But I have been told that lighter color also means higher purity because it has been washed better. Weight was spot on. Also received (SURPRISE) a sample tab of LSD in the package ^_^ I was amazing was not expecting that whatsoever!!!! Since I wasn't told I headed over to pm Haiz to see what it was and after describing it to him he promptly told me it was a tab of 110ug Shiva blotter. Much excitement!!!Summary/Overall: 9/10: Ordering from Haizenberg was a breeze. Vendor was very respectful straightforward and responded quickly. Product took some time to get here but I assume during non-holiday times this would not be so bad. Stealth was OK but could've been better. Extremely high quality product and at such an AMAZING price it's hard to go with anyone but Haiz. Surprised me with an extra goody in the bag much love dude. EXPERIENCE REPORT: Ok so pretty much I told myself I would save HB's MDMA for a festival I will be going to in a few weeks. After about 2 days of having both the LSD and MDMA in my possession I decided I just COULDN'T wait that long. Maybe if it was just the MDMA but I couldn't resist the LSD calling me and telling me to CANDYFLIP FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. Jesus fucking christ it was pretty much the best decision I could've made. I'm so glad Haizenberg made it possible for me to candyflip for the first time in my life. I have tripped a few times and rolled quite a few times both a great experiences but the experience of both together was PHENOMENAL. I would recommend the combination to everyone. I dropped the tab of LSD around 2 pm and just sat around watching Adventure Time and Spongebob for a little while. I was bored. Really just chilled for the first hour talked with my neighbors and hung out with them. Started to feel some euphoria about an hour and a half in being outside was very enjoyable and it seemed to be the only place I wanted to be. After about 3 hours of ingesting the LSD I decided I really was going to candyflip and gently weighed out a 100mg dose of MDMA. I usually dose 150mg but decided 100 would be more preferable for the day. The MDMA kicked in after an hour and a few minutes later after being outside I was on the couch FLOORED. Just couldn't handle standing up and my body felt so light like a cloud I just didn't want to move. Listened to some great Pink Floyd among other great artists during my trip. While I was peaking on both the LSD and MDMA a helicopter flew overhead and it was insanely trippy the LSD heightened all my senses like always and the MDMA intensified ALL of the feelings. I sat on the river behind my house for some time enjoying the outdoors. Headed back inside after some time because it was a bit chilly out. Just hung out inside for a few hours with my roommate good vibes the whole time lots of laughter and fun. About 5 hours after taking the MDMA and 7 hours after taking the LSD a friend asked me if I wanted to go to the beach and going along with something else that happened that night it was pretty much brought up in the perfect situation. It was the perfect time to go to the beach and was exactly what I wanted to do that night. The moon was full and the energies are always intense on those days. My visuals/ hand-eye coordination were light enough/ put together enough for me to be able to handle driving. Fast Forward to the beach it was dark and cold out but that place was the most beautiful place I could've been at that time. The LSD and MDMA were still felt prominently I think the LSD stretched out the euphoric feeling from the MDMA to the point where my roll felt like it never went away. My friend brought some Blue Lotus and I also tried that for the first time had me laying on the sand very relaxed and loving everything. The connection with astral energies was intense. The moon was extremely close and bright and the clouds were moving fast because of the cold front which was amazingly trippy to watch for a while. Just laid there and lost myself in the cosmos with the euphoria and let the feelings take over my body. I was reluctant to leave but it was getting a tad late and I had to work the next day  drove to downtown and we went for some pizza I was surprised I even had the urge to eat","I was hungry. Maybe it was because I hadn't eaten anything the entire day. Fortunately when it was time to eat I didn't feel sick at the sight of food. I was actually excited to have a nice greasy pizza. I went to bed about an hour later (around 3 am) with no problem. There was pretty much NO negative side effects/comedown whatsoever. I went to sleep with absolutely no problem. When I woke up in the morning it felt like I was still tripping/rolling/high!!!!!! Holy shit it felt so amazing. The afterglow the next few days was amazing. I do not regret this at all and again highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good time some soul searching and generally being able to empathize with others well (MDMA effects) while being able to give insightful advice (likely LSD effects clearer thinking etc) at the same time AND also being a great listener. Thank you so much Haizenberg for giving me this opportunity. I love you dude candyflipping was such an amazing experience and your MDMA was bomb as fuck. Will most definitely purchase from you again.","psychedelics",1258,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"142",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","^ Brand Excited to hear your review. Tess ( or any other voices who wish to offer advice )I have been concerned  about the preservation and hadling of our fragile sacraments.I store mine in tinfoil and then stuff that in eaither a book or in a mason jar and put in fridge. Are these acceptable?Also I know LSD is sensitive to lightairheat...but how sensitive? Everytime I handle acid I always feel like it's a race and I have to be quick to not keep it out in the open air for long. I also go into a dimly lit room and I wear latex gloves. Am I going over board? Would having it out for a while in a bright sunny lit room  and handled with my bare hands have any impact on the acid?  Now I've also heard sweat can mess acid up and that when blotter is handled  at the least should be touched by the sides only. Then again I hear some say stuff like this:  ""People tend to say LSD is a lot more fragile than it really is. As long as it doesn't get wet or is exposed to fairly hot temperatures for a long time it's   fine.For instance many people say never let it see light don't let it get above 70f or so but in truth you can leave it in the glove box on a hot day and it'll be fine. You can toss it around without foil and it will be fine. Don't store it in the glove box I would not leave it there but it can be exposed to a bit of heat and light from just nothing extreme it's not going to melt.""So whats the real truth? Can I care freely chuck my blotters in a plastic baggie  keep it in my backpack and dispense as needed. without fear of potency loss? How long before I would have to put in a fridge to avoid potency loss? Also with sheets I've heard some say just lay in tinfoil wrapped over a few times then stuff in a fat bookplace on bookshelf and forget about it.That cool too?Thanks all.By the way tomorrow I'm meeting a bunch of friends at a friend of a friends' art gallery.

I dosed up some peeps who had asked about it.Man It was really nice to look around at wicked art and then see and hear the sounds of awe fromthe dosed up people. The looks were priceless. The giggles. Some tears. Bright sparkly eyes completely breathe taken and rapt with awe- as was I. And to hear the remarks the observations of what they were sensing. Two people were new to the experience. One girl seemed to have abit of a rough spot was complaining of chest tension. After abit of consult she was laughing and over it. I told her it is somewhat psychosomatic but abit of vasocconstriction is common with acid and is not harmful and I shared some of my delicious dark chocolate. All was good. That girl ate a whole tab too...like a champ!My personal experience: I shortly left the art gallery but came back later. wow. This is very strong and  wonderful medicine. Total mindfuck. I had gone into this trip with some intent to learn something and this secured a very real and insightful journey today one which given that I had an intent lead me to some startling discoveries about human relationships. All the visual aspects  were there and then some  but nothing ever felt sensually gratifying for the sake of itself but in that detached view it became more splendid than I could have envisioned ever and you know this exalted beauty where there is no words. This truly was and still is profound. I did not expect what happened. The Synchronicity's  that emerged were almost reflections of how reality unwinds and rewinds itself too adapt to one's current view of how things ought to be. I spent a good amount of time outdoors. I believe  being outside is very good. Anyway i walked down to the waterfront and found myself alone my friend went off to go on his own quest after he left the gallery with me. As a watched the ice blocks collide and shift in a river  the seagulls paid a visit. watched the sky the clouds fractalized and geometrically wove the fine codes that connect the universe. At some point  I guess one might call it Samadhi or satori but it was the purest absorption into this matrix where i was blended in and my body did not exist. Of course as soon as I had become self aware again and came to a thought  ""wow...this is so"" ....bam I was back-  but not really either just diverted into another wave of intense focus and awe. The birds were so kind and as I fed them and we all shared in some succulent tomatoes the ecstatic moment was so present and real that these birds were a gift of life that we all are gifts gifted to be.At some point i made way to a coffee shop. Patterns everywhere trying to decodeThen the voices of people started matching the patterns. I closed my eyes and listened to the hum buzz of chatters all around. It was a symphony  and it had a rhythm. This was very profound. I noticed something very real- people do not speak in fixed pitch or speeds. In fact our voice undulates speeds up and slows down and pitches change as well. But whats more important is how they change in relation to human emotions. As the conversations played out it was if each person was trying to fill gaps and I could feel the push and pull tensions resolving.And so when conversing the tensions would build when neither could find the right filler or creat a resolution but then there was symmetry in their rhythms which lead to a very clear chord of beauty and resolution. It was like human chemistry made through sound expressed through language. There is something there with that. It seems to be a theme now with me communication. The next big oddity happened when I reached in my bag and pulled out a blood orange whilst simultaneously and not related to me a person apparently a student talking with his study buddy says ""present a blood orange""mid sentance.  I could not believe and just laughed  but felt compelled to offer them some and of course  even they were surprised when I just set one on there table and exclaimed ""here's your blood orange!""  There were many moments like this subtle events that just illustrated the interconnectedness of the most disparate thoughts or ideaseven time itself had a new spin a new angle. At some point I got to observe some plants and seeing them up close the sunlight's glow making the leaves somewhat transparent looking yet every vein exposed I saw the cells the little workers buzzing about and again there was a motion a clear rhythm to it all not a blob of shit just splashed togetherno this was the highest art being weaved right before me. What am I? I don't know. This was so much to process and that whole Satori moment seemed easy to just not have to  to decode it to just accept that I can't do it there's nothing to solve. But here I am convinced I will find something but what is it? I stared at some carpet for a long time the weaving became triangular stacks which formed merkabas  each containing more of them  pressed to a point they all kept folding and then got replaced. Ok now what? Am i getting replaced soon too? I don't know. This trip left  me having many questions few answers yet somehow satiated as if I know that At least there ""exists"" an answer I just haven't realized it yet.  I look forward to continuing this journey into awareness with you all hopefully dismantling some problems experience more beauty and maybe have ideas for how to integrate it into a practical usage in our earth trip. so that's that.Now a note of slight  concern and perhaps there is a very good objective answer for this.Tess if you are reading-about the girl who had chest tension- well I had it too. In fact I had it on my last trip before this one. Is this our body chemistry at the time? I hear body load has something to do with the amount of impurities left in the xtal. Could it be that the strip I got came from a batch that was not cleaned well enough?All the other times on Tess' tabs I did not have ANY tensionzero.  I have had other acid at festivals and I got some tension from them too. I have never had what one may call ""bad acid."" I did not allow the tension to bother me. Stretching and taking a deep breath and holding it for a 10 count alleviated the tension ( also gave the visuals a major boost! ) However the tension feeling did persist and is still there now 12.5 hours after initial dose. I'm wondering what this is and if there's something I can do about it besides not take LSDcuz jee that would kinda blow and besaides  nuthin' gonna step between me and Lucyha!   Also I think these tabs were very strong like double dip.  OR maybe my sensitivity to LSD is increasing somehow. All I know is my last two tripsbody load aside have been seriously intense top class grade A++++  flights!Last note my alcoholic friend who drank too much last time and thought Tess' tabs were bunk is now a true believerlol. I demanded he not booze up this time. he stayed sober for this one. He LOVED the acid said it was some of the best he's had in years. So there's a winner! ok over and out. Looking forward.

"147",NA,"the l-team lsd vendors review ~~ look at op","Stopping in to make an indepth vendor review for Blue Viking and trip report.VendorIncredible stealth! I was laughing my ass off about how amazing the packaging was seriously A+++The shipping speed was just as impressive. I think it was only 3 days for me to get my product from the time that I ordered it. This alone makes this vendor invaluable to me and I will continue to buy his products.LSD Review/Trip ReportI'm new to the world of LSD but not to tripping. I have smoked DMT and brewed up my own very potent Ayahuasca and have taken it dozens of times I'm mention this because it's directly relevant to my trip with BV's LSD. The last time I did Aya it was an analogue using Acacia and I had ordered the materials from a different vendor this last time. When I got the rook bark I noticed that it looked weird to me (like a different part of the tree or something) but I went ahead and boiled it up anyways. The liquid itself looked very similar to what it normally did once I finished making it (it has a very unique color) so I felt comfortable with it and went ahead and dosed myself. I was stupid and decided to take a heroic dose from this new batch I just made and also smoke some death pot (by itself it had some ego death/dark qualities to it) while I was still coming up on the Aya. While my work with Aya in the past had been very heavenly I had my shit coming to me this time. A freak thunderstorm rolled in on what was a beautiful sun shining day and absolute horror fell on me (I don't think this was directly tied to the storm but it certainly added to the atmosphere of it). It was like Hell opened up and took over my house and it's surroundings completely. I felt like I had really fucked up and I was eternally damned in this state of suffering. The feeling was one of literally being in a demonic horror film filled with the dark side of witchcraft and the occult. I tried to fight it with music singing and dancing but it just became too overwhelming...I ended up freaking out and screaming. I was sure I overdid it and that today was the day of my death. People talk about beautiful ego death experiences (I've had those plenty of times) but this wasn't one of them.Good thing I was home alone as a sitter would have flipped out as well. This experience left me traumatized for several months both physically and mentally though I already had some issues in the background that factored into this (I had been smoking pot everyday for a good 7 months before this and it had already had some pretty big effects on me mentally i REALLY needed a break). This experience was humbling in literally the worst kind of way but there are some positives to it. My addiction (I don't use this word often but in my particular case it was effecting my health) to pot was literally broken in a day. I didn't smoke for 5 months then another month after that. I did end up going through some serious clinical depression (I was seeing the first symptoms of this before this trip with Aya. Some drug related but a lot of it was just shit that happened in my life the preceding months) throughout those next few months and it was an awful process of recovery for my brain chemistry. I'm proud to say that today I absolutely love life with or without substances and am happier than I've probably every been my entire life. Everyday is glowing for me.Ok so now that the prologue is finished. Onto LSD and Blue Viking.So 7 months later I'm finally ready to start tripping again. I ordered some LSD from another vendor and took 150ug for my first time experience (I'm going to keep this short since this review is for BlueViking). It was an absolutely incredible experience of euphoria and spirituality for me but I knew I wanted it more intense. I was with a friend at a beach during the night around 7pm when peaking. Music and Visuals were nice but I was wanting a bit more kick. I was definitely feeling it though. I had a wonderful conversation with God. I didn't physically see Him or have internal visions of Him like I have at other times but my awareness of Him was as if He was literally a person sitting right next to me (just invisible) as I was vaping my hookah pen. The whole night I was feeling super schnazy and silly the jokes were endless and the bliss was nonstop for many hours throughout the night until I finally made it to bed at 5am.I ended up buying 3 tabs of the 185ug from Blue Viking. 2 weeks after my last trip with LSD I ended up splitting the tabs with a friend making the dose around 272ugs. His LSD is real and very potent. This was an overwhelming trip for both us. It had a polarity to it it was a trip of both Light and Dark and I was left in marvel. The peak was a bit frightening as I was basically hyperventillating at one point and breathing hard (damn cigarettes that I've been smoking plus I was just recovering from being a bit sick with flem). A bit of that Dark shade from the Aya trip opened up however I felt like I was able to walk through it and manage it and I felt a lot of internal development of just being able to embrace the trauma I went through. This is hard to explain but there was also an awe at the Divine Light the mystery of life and the enjoyment of being alive. We were able to watch an incredible sunset over a lake just after the peak of the LSD and it had such an emanation of immortality and bliss with deep conversation of philosophy time and energy. I was ready to stay in that state forever. I must say that the 272ug was a bit too much for me it was less euphoric and more just fucking intense (I don't know how else to say it). I'll probably take 225 mics next time and build back up from there.So we end up leaving the park we were at pick up some food and head back to my friend's place. I decided to eat 2 THC gummies from the vendor RosesGarden at this time (amazing product I highly recommend). So by the time we make it to his house the thc is just starting to kick in and is having a synergistic effect with the Lucy. We get there and my friend's grandpa is home living there as well. I go ahead and eat and end up sitting on the couch watching a movie called the Green Mile with my friend and his grandpa. The THC is hitting me hard and it becomes revealed to me that in this moment my friend's Grandpa is being an incarnated channel of God to me. I suspect that he didn't know about this and I was just in a trance but during this part of the trip our conversation was pretty clear. I was getting some guidance and advice on the direction that I want to take in life. He said some things that really helped me in what to do in fixing some broken relationships with a group of really good friends.Â  He mentioned eternity and my mind was being blown away as time was illuminated and it's expansion was very lengthy at the time. There was this glow in the room and in my peripheral I would see God sitting in the room with us as a person's silhouette in the form of Light but He would talk through my friend's grandpa. I took notes and there was a lot of cool synchronicity happening. There was such a divine glow over all of us and the spiritual connection was ineffable.After I left there I ended up meeting with another friend to go to a local club that plays awesome Trance/House/Progressive/etc music. I took another gummy and ended up dancing the night away. This was the least intense part of the day yet amazing none the less.So overall I felt like my day went like this: The LSD peak was very much like a rebirth the conversation with God was beautiful communion and planning on what to do with my new life and the Rave was like a celebration of this new season of my life. And that's what entheogens will do for you kids! LMAO!With all of that said my advice is to hold the upmost respect for these substance (pot included) or you will get burned","if you build your relationship with the substance and take it slow you'll find a reality so wonderful and glorious you'll be wondering why everyone doesn't just enjoy Heaven on Earth. Start low and build up taking breaks from the substances adds to their beauty and your own stability. And to get back to the thread topic Blue Viking is an incredible vendor and I have already put in another order with him.I hope you found my post at least a little bit entertaining and possibly even a bit educational. Thank you Blue Viking for being an incredible vendor.~Peace!","psychedelics",1596,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I have been doing business with this gentleman for awhile. Let me start by saying that JC is truly a pleasure to do business with you will be hard pressed to find a vendor with more integrity. All the way from communication down to stealth you will be in the hands of a professional. As far as his wares I have sampled both the Dali's and the microdot's and while I enjoyed both greatly I preferred the dots for two reasons quick come up and just plain old novelty. I would say both of them are advertised correctly as far as xtal quality and dosage.We seem to be in the middle of a flood of LSD so there are lots of good products out there it just boils down to finding an honest reliable vendor in that sense SR2 is like the wild west.

"150",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Just dropped in to give a review of BV's 2 C-B that I ordered last week.I had been waiting a long time to get the money to try some 2 C-B and I actually got pretty lucky as I believe I got some of the last of the batch. Anyway I placed my order for 500 mg and it arrived in 2 days. 2 DAYS! And the stealth was just excellent. I don't see how it could have possibly been detected with the care that was taken in packaging it. So after obtaining a milligram scale my friend and I set a night when we would give the product a try. We are both experienced with mushrooms and DMT so we were expecting a pretty light trip. Last night we took 22 mg each and washed it down with juice. It took just a little over an hour to set it until we started seeing the walls breathe. We were watching TV and I started to get a feeling of well-being. We both barely noticed the come-up as we were distracted by the television but after awhile I perceived that we were quite a bit more giggly than normal. All the lights in the room had dull red halos around them and music sounded unusually clear and emotive. After a couple of hours of listening to music and watching shapes on the back of my eyelids I remembered something that I had wanted to try while tripping. This:(CLEARNET SITE) weavesilk.comWe spent pretty much the remainder of the trip (4 hours) playing with this. We would take turns creating while the other one would analyze the work. We could see all kinds of faces shapes and figures in the paintings that were much more difficult to make out in the morning. We kind of made up these storylines to go with the paintings as they progressed and laughed our asses off at the absurdity of them. I highly recommend this for anybody tripping indoors. It seemed like it would never get old.Thanks BlueViking for giving me the opportunity for this experience. 2 C-B proved to be another fun relaxed psychoactive and I still have over 20 doses left! You're a trusted vendor in my book and I look forward to buying some blotters from you in the near future.","psychedelics","388",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"151",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","truthfully while candies are a cool idea and may work as long as blotters remain around i am just fine with that i have to say i've dealt with 2 vendors so far for my LSD and both have come through - i will be testing those Mayans this weekend BV 3 for me 2 for my SO...you know what's crazy LSD (despite being so readily available on the road) is still VERY rare around my part of the US - i live in a fairly big city and if you HAPPEN to know someone who knows someone chances are you'll be sold 25i instead. i always wanted to become a source for the stuff but could very rarely find it in bulk and you never knew the origins. the only real way to make a profit on lsd is if you're getting doses for $5/under each. then you can actually make your money back + $5 per hit because people don't really want to pay beyond that.MDMA on the other hand is a HUGE money maker.dummies around here are selling molly for $160 a gram. yes you heard that right! to top that off people are cutting the shit out of it too so you're probably getting meth methylone etc. i look on the road and avg price for a gram ranges from 30-60. funny how different drugs have such different pricing structures.","psychedelics","234",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

What can I say HOS really knows how to settle problems and do proper business!Really quick responce time faster than any vendor I've ever dealt with by far!!! Really friendly treats you like a friend rather than some quick money.  Willing to work with you your requests and issues! Great person.Shipping/stealth - Shipping took a little while longer than expected but all good! Vendor had some serious problems with Tormarket etc. Very understandable! Promised me 2 freebies with my Shiva's for the lateness.Asked vendor to ship priority even when it wasnt one of the options I got it!! (No previous history with vendor)Stealth was great!! Chuckled at the cleverness. Product - These fucking tabs are SUPERB. Oh lord. My first experience with these I took a THIRD (1/3 50ug) of a tab. I wasn't looking for a trip that day really just excited to try them and make my day a bit better. Nope. Such a pleasant come up cheesy grin the whole time. Very nice experience such a nice mindfuck really opened my eyes to LSD without all the visuals. Spiritual as fuck. lasted easily 8 hours then visual after effects persisted. The second time (1 week later) I took a half. (75ug) Very very nice Super clean L. Went to the beach got a sweet tan. This dose came with visuals.. I saw a LOT of letters/characters/mayan writing type shit on EVERY rough surface that there was. Colors were bright.. intense.. felt very sexual and absolutely loved life. laughed about the most i have in the past year.. mouth hurt at the end of the day. Awesome experience. Third one was one of the freebies a Dali. These had a slight taste to them as explained by HOS. NO burning. Taste didn't last long at all.  (NOTE: this was 5 days after my last trip which was a week after my first) The come up was about the same Visuals a bit more intense. Nice headfuck for a good amount of time. Visuals started getting crazy trails like 2 feet long. Fracals Numerals Characters in every form everywhere rainbow colors vibrating through them. Headfuck started going away.. trip ended a bit early but all of these effects would be much more pronounced if i waited at least 2 weeks like im supposed to!! Ooops.. I just love Lucy. Still If you are going to purchase I recommend SHIVAS!!!! Sweet design no taste AMAZING L. Family Fluff it is   I'm waiting 2 weeks then taking a full Shiva. I will report back to here once I do!Overall: 5/5. Vendor is amazing about to place an order for more shivas   and some MDMA. Cannot wait!DO NOT HESISTATE to order from House Of Spirit.

I FE'd happily after talking with him and seeing his feedback thread. He kindly posted it tracked for me and express (at his own cost) in an attempt to get it here in time for the 31st. Unfortunately it arrive on the 3rd but he constantly was in communication with me the whole time giving me updates on tracking etc. I feel as though this was only due to the Christmas Post situation as well as the arge number of postal holidays here around that period.In terms of quality it was on par with the best cocaine I have tried. For those of you who are veterens of SR 1 think Sukey and Lloydsbrothers. Absolute fire.Stealth was very good as well. MBBs used and extremely appropriate packaging I have no doubt it would be no issue shipping large amounts either.Customer service: Hiniguel goes above and beyond constantly answering questions of mine that are completely unrelated to my order in relation to good IRL operational practices.Honestly can't speak highly enough of this vendor an absolute credit to SR. If you are Australian and enjoy international quality drugs think no further than Hiniguel.

In generall they gave me an overall reassuring feeling they are a good vendor to order through.  The shipping and stealth were superb on time frame from order to delivery there was even a suttle Joke well discuised in the packaging cover letter which made me laugh. The vendor shipped the product in a clever way and had a little fun with it without compromising stealth. Brilliant. The product quality in terms of accuracy relating to dose in product as it was described was spot on in my opinion and the quality of the LSD was top notch. I could not have been happier with the 2 different types of tabs sent to me. My girlfriend had never taken LSD before so she had the Strawberry 100ug whilst I had the Fat Freddy 200ug She has never consumed any form of psychedelic before whilst I have experience taking a dozen or so varieties of Psilocybin mushroom and have taken many different tabs from street vendors over the last 15 years. However it was my first trip in about 18 months. I will keep this tale of our night short and sweet however in reality our night seemed to be untouched by time  we turned off all access to time watches were removed media access phones ect were put away. We wanted nothing to disturb us. Apart from our dog who was awesome to have around. we have no idea how long we tripped for. We have a very strong relationship but it is even better for having a little trip together. LSD for me is a Thinker’s tool it allows me to create an exploded view of my personal world and analyse from an almost 3rd party perspective of whats going on in my head accessing my most intimate of thoughts even so I was consiously unaware of.  LSD molecules rush through my brain smashing open doors and removing filters giving me a clarity on thoughts I may not ever have even considered before.  It opens up a massive area of my brain that is usually closed off and inaccessible. I imagine it could be a feeling like what Tibetan monks calll enlightenment.  It returns to me that child like feeling of wonder. We  had a perfect night dim lighting from various lamps created a warm safe cozy feeling. We listened to a playlist we created especially for the night.  My lounge is very plush and sensory. Deep pile soft new carpet soft huge couch our own creation of our ideal bolt hole from the world. We relaxed quickly and embraced our experience. I could bore you for hours so I will stop soon.Thank you LSDaisy your product is top class and I will be ordering a stock next time so we can keep some for a day out in the sunshine when It gets warm in summer.","psychedelics","505",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I hope my paranoia is silly and I actually get this stuff because opportunities like this are rare and temporary. After taking it hopefully I'll understand your dedication to helping people get this stuff but it's already clear that there must be a reason this stuff isn't dying after all sick efforts to kill it. It's obviously working for the most part though so just stay happy that there will always be safe places like this in the world and that you played a big part in one. Only ever be responsible for yourself though and leave when you have to leave whether it means leaving the silk road and going somewhere else or ditching everything.

You won't even find service better than that cute waitress that's giving you alot of attention for no reason.Okay on to the Product: so imma start at 0am which is eating the spongebob full 1 hit of 185ugs. I have never did anything pass 100ug and my experiences with lucy isn't alot but i love it!1am: I am an hour into this and I already feel like im flying and im keep trying to for some reason twist my body and what ever actions i do towards the ""center"" because i feel like the world is bending hard. EDIT: I am on top the of fucking world right now! and i feel like im flying lol and i cant control myself with laughing. in my mind im just yelling to myself ""in the spirit of house Namaste!"" Also i must say I on one seriously hard right now while trying to write this.130am: i feel like im slowly drifting into double vision. its all so amazing to me since ive never experienced anything quite like this. the only thing i cant rid of this big fat happy smile from my face. i dont how to properly explain this but the more i try to think into it i feel like the halves of my brain and body working against each other and trying to pull myself away into two worlds. but if im letting it ""sync"" together with the music im listening to its such wonderful bliss. so fucking happy and peaceful its literally like a movie right now and i have front row seats to my ownself!<----this is probably the best summation of the night i will have. HAHAHAHAH!!!2am: i am fucking melting! omg wowwww!!!! i dont know how much deeper this rabbit hole goes but holy crap. The idea of reality is really starting to melt but i think i think still manage maybe its that .15ug thats not there who knows?<---- i have no clue how i able to write this thought at all btw. i guess i will just leave this in here so the experience can be felt first handedly from a first timer journeying into the unknown to be as real(if that has any meaning anymore) as possible. If any thing the lesson i will be learning here tonight is being grounded mentally. The unknown is not necessarily a bad one either. after all this is all in my mind anyways! hahahahaha!4am: im still flying shit balls but i think if i could like literally let go i could be out of the universe for real. but at this time i for certain i can stay grounded and just enjoy reality once again. the feeling of being drunk and knowing theres no terrible hangover at the end =)5am: so i took a dare and i decided to enter what i called the bathroom it was a saga which i wasnt sure if i was able to go through. but i went through it. you can literally spend all day in the shower the feeling of water and even to hearing each individual drops is beautiful. this was the first time where i literally hallucinated them mind gamez like HoS was saying. For example I could hear a concert in the back of mind but only to realize that it was the sound of the water going down a drain and creating hollow sounds. I would say to anyone who isnt prepared to go into crazy can either be in a carnival full of amazing beauties or nightmare and you cant find the way out when the door is 1ft away from you. this was just the bathroom. makes me think that the double rainbow guy isnt that far off lols6am: while think i am back from a holy looooooooooonnnnnnggggggg tripppp i mean things are still breathing. i am now in the back DOWN on a stage im comfortable with which is the stage of infancy where im like a kid again and everything fascinates me. especially the TV show Fringe. im wondering how many other people out there like this show as well =D8am: so im still pretty fuking high kind of like im on molly. it makes me wonder if thats even possible? can i try to imagine myself on something else and make myself feel like im on it? afterall it is a psychelic ^^. I have trouble making sense of simple sentences. my body feels like dancing to the music im listening to. at this time in my mind im already trying to collect my thoughts and all i can think of is some people out there have it way worse and im lucky to be alive and i hope some of them truly find peace. EDIT: WHERE THE FUCK ARE my manners at. I never asked HoS if i could use up a shit ton of space in his thread. I seriously hope you don't mind. I couldn't of think anything else on how to properly review your product so I'm documenting my trip report.(2am?)---->this will probably be at the end way later but: i am already having deeper thoughts and i already know when i land on the ground FULLY that i will think back to this ocassion.Me Sober: please note above that this should all be taken into account that I am a complete noob with lucy still. i learn to respect this special little molecule the first time trying it but after last night. holy shit. I can now really understand why people saying if ur taking that much you must REALLY know what your doing. i was respecting what JOR was saying about the dosages about ""150ugs hold on to your seats because shit morphing might not be uncommmon."" with all that above i feel totally mind cleansed and absolutely enjoyed the bobOverall: 11/10I absolutely recommend House.","psychedelics","1046",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"165",NA,"gfn product review thread (mdma lsd mda shrooms foxy and more?)","I agree with the contrast JuicyMango & mdawsome described between MDA and MDMA but I would say that for most people getting ""slightly"" more high with the same dose is quite an understatement.  What I find to be a thresh hold recreational dose of MDMA is a heavy dose of MDA and a moderate dose of MDMA gets me absolutely fucked.  The higher the dose the bigger the difference.  This may vary from person to person but I know a lot of people who seem to be affected similarly.  This may also vary with the source of the MDA either because some is buffed more or less or not at all or an innocent differing of stereo-isomer ratios as a result of how it was synthesized.  My observations are based on my own personal experiences and what other people have told me of theirs and based off experiences with the same MDA that I supply.I definitely find them both to be empathogens but MDMA more forcefully where as MDA allows for intensified empathy if your set & setting are conducive to it but I feel more emotionally in control with MDA and more like myself.  I tend to be more emotionally overwhelmed on MDMA but more euphoric and otherwise high on MDA - and like I said in equal doses I find MDA far more powerful but I take much less usually.You should dose carefully with MDA until you get a feel for it.  It's stronger has little to no cross tolerance and mine should be weighed not eyeballed (until you have a feel for it then do whatever you're comfortable with) because it's *very* dense (compared to most MDMA) so you're likely to take more than you think you're taking if you eyeball it.","psychedelics","295",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Now onto the product itself. I've taken MDMA for years pills used to be great but then with methylone and other research chemicals it was just too unreliable. This guy knows his shit. .175g and no joke 25 minutes later it hit so hard it was like my first time. for about 5 minutes I just kept sitting down and getting up. Then I had a bit of stomach distress burped then threw up. Ide say 2 out of 5 times when I've taken mdma I've yacked. Even after I yacked there was another 20 min where I had to just chill becaues the come up was so strong. This is as pure as it gets.

"167",NA,"official mr. chill mushroom edibles review thread***","Anyone who likes to trip on shrooms is really missing out if they don't try Mr.Chill's edibles. I can't speak about the tea or the suckers just yet but the Chill Pill Chocolates are the bomb.I'm honored to give a top score over all for Mr.Chill on the sample I recieved. Stealth was very adequate with it being a chocolate it just would appear that I was getting some candy in my mail. Nice! You can't tell anything even after breaking the chill pill apart. Nor is there any indication from the scrumptious flavor of these bad boys.Mr.Chill told me that the chocolate would cause the come up to take a little longer than when you eat raw shrooms. He was right. I ate my Chill Pill at one setting eating half of it with the first bite. Wow! How deliscious! This thing was a mouth watering delight. Madew with real milk chocolate it melts in your mouth and the texture is so smooth and soft. If I had 100 of these I would be tripping balls for days because I could not stop eating them til they were gone. No doubt one of the best shroom trips I've had from just 2.2 mg what? It was close to 90 minutes to 2 hours but it did hit me like a freight train just like Mr.Chill said it would. I was setting here listening to music and I felt the warmth coming from my stomach. I had to go outside and the minute I opened the screen door and looked out the ground started to roll like there was hot lava travelling under neath it. From that point on it was on for the next 5 hours. The trees were waving and the clouds were moving (with no wind) i couldn't tell if they were really moving or if I was just tripping. The come down was incredibly smooth and non existant and I felt great the next day. Thank you Mr.Chill I wish you all the best and lots of prosperity. I'll be coming to shop at your shop once things smooth out and I get the bills caught up. You are very gifted with making these Chill Pills","psychedelics","370",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

His shipping method is flawless this would pass the 'mom test' if you lived with your parents. Its that good. Communication is also amazing it seems like he actually wants to communicate with you. And the product is AMAZING         First the LSD I took 3 hits of the Shivs OHMS. I have taken acid many many times (75+) and this was the most visual and 2nd cleanest acid I had ever taken. My buddy and I joked it was like movie acid. Swollow this shit and within 30 minutes you're tripping one hour later and you are tripping balls. And no this is not NBOME no taste no nausea and there is an actual headspace. Anyway this acid truly was incredible","I tripped balls for 14 hours and it was amazing. The visuals were like LSD x LSD (LSD^2). The colors were so spectacular and the fractals were nearly overwhelming. I experienced many LSD 'firsts' on this trip.       FirstWhile driving (in a cab) through a tunnel I entered some surreal hyperspace akin to TRON.  Like I left my body for a split second  and became enveloped by red laseresque tracers. A truly breathtaking experience.  Next The visuals were so vivid and I had actual hallucinations. YAY!! I am not talking intense patterns (which were omnipresent) I am talking about objects morphing into other objects. Strait movie shit!! My friend morphed into an anteater infront of my eyes.  I absolutely lost it when this happened. Imagine watching an anteater tell a joke so surreal!           I also experienced synthesia for the first time.  That shit is overwhelmingly euphoric. More naturally euphoric than any drug I have ever experienced. I literally saw sound felt sound was sound.  What does sound look like you say? Well it looked alot like the scrolls of paper that player piano's read from.  Except the sound was visible in three dimensions so each note gently pushed out a cookie cutter hole in the patterns that enveloped me. It is hard to explain but if it happens/happened to you I am sure you'll get where I am coming from. Last and certainly not least: I experienced Telepathy. I am sure you are thinking fuck this dude  but I am serious.  My friend and I truly became one as we both were able to communicate in our minds. We were chillin' on his couch after a long day in the park and I began to hear my buddy's voice in my head.  I started to chat with him in my head and we discussed if this was really happening.  We decided(without saying a word) to test if it was telepathy by counting down to 3.  On the count of three we were supposed to grab each other's hands. And after three seconds we grabbed eachother's hands and LOST OUR SHIT. It was an amazing experience.  Plus this acid was soo clean. It felt like everyone of my cells was getting hosed down by a powerful power washer shooting you guessed it LSD. After the trip I felt refreshed and satisfied with my life. Would recommend.       Now onto the MDMA. I like many people loved mdma my first few rolls. But after the 6th or 7th time the magic began to erode. Even after year + t breaks and buying the 'best' mdma from vendors from Canada and the Netherlands i was still underwhelmed by MDMA. That was until I received HOS MDMA. Holy shit was it good brought back the magic full force. I was a puddle of pleasure. My eyes were shuddering like crazy and it felt sooo good. Honestly better than my first roll. One .2 dose produced a 4 hour peak smooth comedown and great afterglow the following day. No suicide Tuesdays no feeling etarted no depression. Felt good man. House you should consider yourself one of Shulgin's disciples!So all in all Thanks a million HOS. I cannot thank you enough for hooking me up with the dankest entheogens around.Namaste!!!!","psychedelics",770,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"172",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","  Clear your mind?  try smoking weed about 2-3hr before and meditate.  You don't have to meditate the whole time you just have to think about [nothing] or whatever you hope to improve about yourself on the trip.  I have found that thinking about nothing can be difficult at times.  Close your eyes breathe in through the nose out through the mouth just listen to the sound.  Do this for 10min right after you drop then go for a 10min walk sit back down put on some music meditate more and feel the love! I used to think that I had to 'keep up' with my trip and I would have to go down to the bottom and climb back up.  Now  I just become a pool of water or a small stream that ripples and flows.  When the trip is really intense and I get ego loss it can be very pleasant relieving physical and mental pain.  Depersonalization can be avoided by the inception of a positive thought to trip on just try thinking of something even remotely funny and laugh really hard.  See if you can hear or feel the vibration of the universe it might take a bit but you might find it.      Hope that helps! I like to give people advice on tripping as I feel an obligation to those who helped me along the way during my spiritual and recreational journey into psychedelia.  You can also try to develop a bit of a ritual to gain your confidence","meditation a cup of tea/wine a smoke light a candle and the tripping mindstate will return to you when you do it the next time.","psychedelics",280,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"174","house of spirit shiva ohm lsd review - first timer","This post is overdue but as with most things that I care about people’s reactions to I procrastinated. I should start out by saying that HouseofSpirit is one of the most genuine vendors I have dealt with on the darknet markets. I’ve had my share of interactions and stupid questions asking vendors to do this or that for me but HoS was more than willing to answer my questions help me out and make up a custom order for me. So as far as communication and friendliness goes I have yet to meet someone better. About his stealth it is incredible! I mean just so flawless that even someone looking for the package might confuse it. You can order with the extreme confidence that you have nothing to worry about as far as stealth goes with HoS. This vendor is the REAL DEAL.The product. Let me say this I had never taken LSD before Friday night so I don’t have a very good comparative experience. I had always been scared to try it because of those horror stories I was told growing up about people taking one hit and tripping for the rest of their life. As a side note there was a rumor when I was growing up about one of my old high school teacher’s son who took acid and freaked out and stole some kids. How true is that story? Probably not at all. Anyway I decided that I would not only trip on acid for my first time Friday night but that I would also trip alone for my first time (I’ve done shrooms countless times and DMT once mescaline a few times etc. but always with someone). I was scared I won’t lie. I stared at the blotters for 15 minutes not sure what to do. I looked up at the picture of my Guru closed my eyes and tricked myself into putting one Shiva OHM blotter on my tongue. I tried to meditate but I was way too nervous. So I laid down with the movie “Home” playing. What happened exactly I cannot tell but I felt myself journey through countless lifetimes and watch the birth of endless beings on this earth. I watched the entire creation it was incredible. I almost had no idea what was happening because it felt so natural. Once the movie ended I fully realized what was happening. I was immediately filled with extreme euphoria unlike anything I can describe. I was lying on my floor like a puddle totally blissed out. I can only compare it to an really pure molly sort of euphoria and love. For a long time I was in a position of total surrender. That was all I wanted to do surrender everything to this beautiful Infinite Consciousness. I was so full of gratitude it was hard to express it all (I tried sending a lot to HoS wherever he may be in this cosmos). I was also filled with energy I wanted to laugh and smile and dance and create. Now I’m not typically a creative person (damn science brain!) but I began writing drawing and strumming my guitar holy shit it was like an orgasm when I was strumming my guitar. I couldn’t handle it. The feel of the guitar in my hands was the best thing ever and when I strummed notes I was sent into a dimension of pure vibrational love. It was so beautiful. There was certainly a lot of morphing and melting going on","859",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"175",NA,"detailed review/trip report: pimpit lsd","Hello everyone. Today I share with you my account of tripping on Pimpit's LSD. I'm new here so heres a little background to give you some context. Background: I'd say I am moderately experienced at tripping acid. The first stuff I ordered from SR was from Tessellated and I have never gone anywhere else (until now). I don't need to go into detail here about how amazing Tess' product is but the vast majority of my trips have been thanks to Tess. I decided to order from Pimpit because he was offering an 11/10 deal on 250ug hits if the buyer FE'd. This was too good an offer to pass up and I recall the price being pretty reasonable for the dosages. I did some research on Pimpit's product and was pleased to see a plethora of raving reviews for the vendor and product. ==========Vendor: Good communication. I messaged him just to let him know that I was claiming the 11/10 offer and say hello. This was my first time ever FE'ing for anything not to mention from a vendor I've never ordered from either. So I just wanted to drop a line and let him know my concerns. Even though I wasn't expecting a response he left me a note to let me know he got my message which made me feel pretty encouraged. Shipping/Stealth: This was actually my first order on the new SR so it felt like the first time all over again. I was genuinelly concerned whether or not I would actually get my product due to FE'ing and the risk of getting scammed but the order made it to Mid-west USA within 7 business days. Stealth was out of this world. This is the best I've ever seen from anyone on SR so far. Trip report (now for the good part): Long story short this LSD is amazing. However the experience I had with Pimpit's LSD was much different than what I've experienced with Tess' LSD: I dropped around 3pm. Each tab was 250ug so I knew I would be strapped in for the better part of at least 8 hours. I ate the tab left it under my tongue for ~30 mins then washed it down with some delicious H2O. I putzed around on the internet waiting for it to kick in and prepared the house bong for all the rips I knew I was going to take in the next several hours. About an 1.5 hours in I began to feel the effects. It was a very subtle gentle come up and it took me a while to actually realize it had hit me. The primary thing that I noticed with Pimpit's acid is that it's much less visual than Tess'. When tripping with Tess' stuff it usually kicks in within an hour and theres usually a distinct moment when I look at something and I'm like YUP FASTEN YOUR SEATBELT (I suddenly notice the walls start to melt or something). I was anticipating something like this happening but it never really did. So I spent the first 2 or so hours wondering if the dose I took was just weak or something. To be clear: at about 2 hours in I definitely FELT like I was tripping. Theres that distinct ""frosty"" feeling inside where it just feels like you're bursting with energy and your heartrate is elevated (Its how I imagine Tony Stark feels when he put his upgraded triangle Arc Reactor for the first time in IM2)Â  But the visuals were relatively mild. If I concentrated on one thing visuals would begin to appear but they just seemed smaller and more ""concentrated"" in a way. This acid felt heavier as if its real effect was happening inside my body. I've read people describe certain LSD as giving them a ""body high"" and I think that description sounds pretty accurate to Pimpit's stuff. Anyway after about 2 hours in I did what I love doing most when I'm on acid: Crank up the tunes and jam out. I blasted off with some Bassnectar (for those who have not experienced Bassnectar on acid WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!? Those that have know exactly what I'm talking about). The music was mesmerizing as always and I seemed to ""feel"" the music more than I did on Tess' acid. The air was dripping with Nectar's sweet 808 bass and crazy electro-lasers. It was magnificent but I was slightly distracted by the fact that I wasn't getting the visuals that I was expecting. Around 6pm my roommate came home (His most recent experience with acid was when I gave him a full hit of Tess' 200ug and he was blown away). He had some shrooms that he wanted to take but upon searching his room high and low for his stash determined that they were probably stolen or inadvertenly taken at some point in the past month. Being the good roommate that I am I offered him a dose of Pimpit's acid and he was totally down. By this point I was tripping balls. The visuals were still relatively minor but I was quite jittery and found myself laughing at the most mundane of things. I was in a fantastic mood now that I wasn't alone anymore and had someone to chill with. At this point I decided that I would dose again. My acid fueled logic at the time went like this: The first dose I took was the extra 11th tab that came with the FE deal. So I suspected that maybe that does wasn't 250ug as advertised or maybe it was from a different batch that was old or something. So I sliced off 2 tabs one for me and one for my roommate. Using the scissors to cut the paper felt like I was cutting huge thick slices of acid pie for us to eat. So we both dosed and headed to my room to rip the bong and listen to more music. I was still feeling fantastic and the fact that I could chill with someone took my mind off the subject of the visuals. We cruised through some more Bassnectar and this time was even crazier than my first jam sesh. I cranked the volume up way loud and let the air bleed with the heavy dripping basslines. And bleed it did. We sampled Mesmerizing the Ultra (FUCKING AMAZING) Timestretch (ARE YOU KIDDING ME) and watched some live concert footage on youtube of various sets from his 2013 Immersive Tour (OMG). At this point we were in full swing. My roommate's tab started to kick in and we were both captivated by wave after wave of Nectar amazingness. The thing about not having as much visuals was that it allowed me to really focus on feeling the music (this is harder to do when everything you look at is like a melting fractal kaleidescope). I felt extremely relaxed and comfortable yet it seemed like my mind was becoming fully integrated into the sound waves that were blasting out of the speakers. I wan't sure if my roommate was feeling Bassnectar as much as I was (he's a very classic rock guy) so I decided to take us back a few decades and rock out to some classics. We had our minds melted by Van Halen's Eruption (holy FUCK) ""Panama"" and ""Jump"" (Sweet MOTHER of Jesus!) and then dabbled with some ZZ-Top and Allman Brothers (""Jesus just left Chicago"" and ""Whipping Post"" respectively. No words). The electric guitars blasted directly through us and I swear I felt my brain leaking out of my ears after Duane Allmans dazzling performance on Whipping Post. At this point the lack of visuals were no longer concerning to me. I heard that music for what felt like the first time and was completely captivated by it. The acid was definitely in full swing and visuals even started to appear regularly and spontenously (likely because of my double dose). These visuals were your standard acid visuals: fractals tesselations and kaleidescopeness abound but THESE visuals seemed thicker slower and more deliberate almost as if it was my body experiencing the visuals rather than my eyes (I hope that made sense?). Up next was ""Smashers and Mashers"" which is 30 minutes of the most crazy mesmerizing hypnotic music you will ever hear ever courtesy of Bassnectar. Here is where things get interesting. As the mix went on and on both of us delved deeper inside of ourselves (my roommate would later corroborate my experience by saying he went through very similar things). My innermost thoughts began to bubble to the surface of my consciousness and I began to feel like my true self. I began to have realizations about my current situation in life and I felt braced with confidence. I realized that many of the things holding me back from what I desired were simply self-constructed fears to protect my vulnerable ego my ego which seemed to be revealing its true nature. I sat calmly and pondered my life with a brand new perspective clear from the biases and filters that have plagued me in real life. When the mix came to an end my roommate and I looked at each other with an unspoken understanding: holy FUCK what did we just experience?! We talked about Bassnectar and our lives what our plans were and how we felt about our current state. We went out and made some food; somehow my roommate whipped up some crazy good quesadillas. The flavors nourished my soul and the food gave me satisfaction and some new energy. We went back to my room and got ready for another jam sesh. This time it was ""Freestyle"" another masterpiece from I think you can guess who. Again we sat calmly and quitely as the crazy hip-hop beats blasted us through another dimension. I stared at a framed photgraph of Planet Earth on my wall and realized that I am a human and the courage to make my dreams reality was real it was a real part of me. Indeed I realized that this is true for all of us. All of my petty rationalizations and fears began to peel away as I sat there as a purely vulnerable and true being. At this point saying that I felt like Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen would be an appropriate description. I was fully immersed in the double dose of acid and the body high had me gripped like a vice. I felt like I was glowing and my liberated mind projected truth after truth about myself and who I am into the realm of my consciousness. At this point it was 10pm and our other roomates came home. We chilled and shot the shit for about an hour and I made some food. I wasn't ready to be done but my roommate decided to call it a night after about 11:30 or so. I went back to my room and continued where I left off. I felt that the peak of the acid had passed and was now beginning to wind down (still tripping hard nonetheless). I felt totally relaxed and again let my mind wander and explore the space of my consiousness free from fears and negative feelings. I did this until about 3AM at which point I decided to turn off the music and go to sleep at which point I officially concluded my trip. Conclusion: All in all this was one of the best and most relevatory acid trips (if not THE most) I've ever been on. Looking back I was pleasantly suprised by the different ways in which the drug effected my mind and how I perceived my surroundings. Because the visuals were not as intense I was able to remain relativley calm and not be distracted by melting walls and visions of travelling through the universe (as unspeakably awesome that is). This is not to say that there were no visuals. At no point did I find myself asking ""Why are there no visuals?"". I only found myself wondering if the visuals would become stronger. This allowed me to focus on myself my feelings and who I was which was why I found it to be such a deep powerful trip. My experience with Pimpit and his LSD receives an outstanding 5/5 rating.==============Â  Thanks for reading!

"177",NA,"the l-team lsd vendors review ~~ look at op","A few days ago I took 1 Twins blotter from The Heineken at a party. The blotter was tasteless.The trip was strong. I had a somewhat difficult comeup due to anxiety and the setting. Then the peak was godly. The hearing was awesome dancing was awesome visuals were quite pronounced the body felt great... Only problem is for a few hours I was unable to understand human language. Strong acid mindfuck. And oh is this a psychedelic trip (again) what is life? And so on. After I stopped trying to understand what was happening it was blissful and I was basically free to do what I wanted the way I wanted to. And everyone looked soooo beautiful. I was really horny actually. ^^I'm more a solo tripper. It was my 2nd time with acid at a party but i may do it again at a party (this love is wonderful) probably with a slightly lower dosage if the setting is unsure like this time.The Twins are strong I think two of them would have lead to total ego-dissolution... Like this one time I took 3x 100ug blotters from another vendor. So the dosage seems pretty accurate for the Twins.I still have 1 Aum blotter from The Heineken to try and I will do this in a private setting not soon though.

"178",NA,"tessellated lsd review (and mdma)","So I've done LSD a few times in the past but was never really convinced that I had the full experience due to not always knowing how much I had taken or the quality. I've found that the LSD I recieved from Tesselated answered all of my questions. I thought I had done acid before but this was an entirely new experience which I cant really describe in any detail.I'm 6' tall and 160LBS. I did a full tab of 200ug and approximately 300ug of MDMA also from Tessellated.Took the MDMA in a series of doses. The LSD and MDMA were both fantastic! I was worried that 1 tab might be too much. I was able to handle it pretty well but I do have experience which helped when things got a bit wierd.  I did it alone in my appartment. I had it all planned out to mainly watch nature movies and other trippy shit.  It was hard to stay tuned to one thing though. Ended out watching BBC earth and BBC life muted while listening to classical music. It was amazing lol!!!  I found classical music to be most approprite tried listening to pink floyd and it was good (I'm a huge fan) but it just dudn't compare to the purity of Beethoven or George Winston other classical stuff. I did the first 50ug of MDMA at the same time I dropped the acid because I read that it helps to ease you into the LSD trip. I think it did help cause I felt pretty good going in.  I had the tab in my mouth for ~ 40 min.  I started to really notice it ~ an hour after I dropped.I was up all night friday and the drugs wore off at around 3 PM Saturday.  I wasn't really tired and I didn't want to screw up my sleeping schedule so I decided to stay up. I did take a 3 hour nap on saturday evening then stayed up until 3AM where I was able to sleep no problem. Slept in until 1:30 PM on Sunday and went to bed at 12 AM that night.  Wasn't really tired for work on Monday but was still in a little bit of a daze. haha.  But it wasn't bad maybe I was just paranoid. Overall a great experience! I might have over did it on the MDMA I probabely shouldn't have had that extra dose however it was fun and I'm feeling pretty good going into the next week. No regrets.  I will definately be taking a break of both of these drugs for atleast a few weeks but looking forward to my next trip! The high from the LSD was a very nice and clean feeling.   Solid gold.TRIP LOG ( made entries at different points of the trip )-----------------------------------FRIDAY 5 PM: dropped 1 tab of 200ug LSD + ~50ug of MDMA in capsule8:41 Vaped 1/3 bag of sour D9:30 2 hot knives of indica hash945 Tripped on Beethoven with BBC life on mute. 10:30 Stupidly responded to girlfriend's text accidently near peak period1100 Visuals are peaking1200 Pink Floyd and BBC earth1AM visuals have gone down120 Doritos Zesty1:45 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas245 ~120ug MDMA (starting to come down from the LSD )3:20 Start to feel the MDMA345 Rolling345 Vaped a 1/3 of a bag410 Rolling; Indica hash blades and half a bag from the vape.430 Jaw tension - teeth grinding - Rolling with momentum!530 ButterKing budder hoots ( had to dig through my freezer to find this stuff worth the effort)609 Coming down from MDMA; Amber oil hoots720 ~ 100ug MDMA830 Feeling great back in the roll920 ~75ug MDMA12:10PM starting to level out; continuing to use cannabis ----------------------------------------------------------- APPENDIX A -  Additional Comments-----------------------------------------------------------Thanks for the comments.   Glad people enjoyed the review.  I wanted to write more stuff but I could probabely write an entire book on that night and so I though I would keep it fairly simple.  If anyone wants to ask any specific questions I'll do my best to answer. In the following paragraphs I'll try to zoom in on a few experiences to expand the report a bit. LSD is amazing.  I felt like a scientist the entire time (though I sort of am a scientist) analyzing and trying to explain everything that was happening. I highly recommend doing LSD in a safe and comfortable environment and at a reasonable dose (for first timers).  If you're fairly new to psychadelics and also not really a veteran of drugs in general I wouldn't recommend taking a full tab of Tessellated's LSD. You'll probabely have a really good time on half.  I found my trip on 1 full tab to be perfect. It was crazy enough to keep me really interested but not to crazy to make me lose control. When the LSD started to effect me in hour 2 and 3 I noticed that i did alot of laughing. This is because I was always saying ""wow"" as it progressed. I just kept thinking back to what people had said about LSD and what it does (though I had done it before and hadn't had these experiences) and thinking ""yuuuup... this is happening... this is the real deal"". One of the things that I was compelled to do when the trip started was pick up my accoustic guitar. I hadn't planned on playing it but it just happened naturally. I played a few songs and also just did some finger picking and other stuff. It was really...REALLY COOL! It was really nice but when I put it down to take a break I forgot about it... and just moved on to somthing else. When I was starting to peek I would go and stand in my kitchen and look at the linoleum floors and the patterns were moving fluidly. It wasn't the same patterns repeating instead it was all liquid and fluid. Like a steady flow of distorted reality.. lol... or somthing.I did look in the mirror at one point during the peak phase and it was interesting.  Actually what I saw was many faces they were all me but just slight differences. It was almost like time lapse of different pictures of my face it was wierd.  And I had this sort of mental trip too looking at myself and I had like a hundred thoughts about myself and who I am as a person. It was pretty wierd. Lets just say that I didn't hang out at the mirror for too long but I did want to try it. A warning to all... LSD brings out the truth. I noticed this alot when I was watching the BBC nature films as well. You get a very different perspetive on LSD and you ""see"" things differently. Anyway the warning is that if you have serious issues with self esteem other problems etc... you might want to go easy on the LSD IF you're alone.I consider myself to be a good person and I've been told by others that I am a good person etc. So I was fairly comfortable with the mirror situation however when I did look at myself from a different perspective I saw that I had a sad look about me and I realized that I do carry alot of emotional pain and it kind of put things into perspective for me that I should start letting go of some of the past and put more emphasis on realizing all of the great things that I DO currently have in my life instead of focusing so much on the bad things. It was actually pretty emoutional I just saw myself as a sad person which I'm not. I do have some emotional baggage though but overall I'm very happy being me. So yeah maybe avoid the mirror when you're trippin. I'd imagine it could get pretty fucked up for some people. So I'm tripping and I had ignored girlfriend's previous call. I took the LSD at 5PM and so I was planning on calling her at around 12 AM and say that I napped. As long as I wasn't drinking she probabely wouldnt notice anything unusual because I usually eat cannabis brownies on the weekend anyway so I could have used that excuse. Well.. she texts me asking if I was ok and saying that she's worried and uses a sad emoticon. I reacted without thinking and responded ""Ya"" lol. And she immidiately says "" call me""  and then the phone rings. LOL I'm thinking ""fuck"". so I answered it and it was tough to play strait. So I ended out telling her that I was on shrooms and that I was weirded out and asked if I could talk to her later. She got a bit upset and said not to bother and that she was turning off her phone.  So I basically just brushed it off and decided that I would deal with it later. Hahaha.. I actually had to hide the phone on my bed under a big pile of blankets. Once I did that I felt better. Resume trip!  *Note: Everything worked out alright with us.  I had to appologize for ""being sneaky"" and a few things like that but we're good.\I noticed that alot if not most of the trip was just thinking. There were alot of visuals too but it was mainly my thoughts that created alot of the experience. Which actually makes sense when you think about the nature of the drug.I was suprised that I did do some martial arts techniques in slow motion. I wanted to leave that stuff out of the trip due to it being partly violent. Wasn't sure if that might cause a turn in the wrong direction. However it was really peacefull just slowly doing the motions and streatching a bit. Pretty cool!I didn't eat when I got home from work though I did have a roast beef sandwich and soup for lunch which was very filling. I started to feel hungry at around 10PM. It wasn't a bad hunger feeling but I felt like I could eat somthing. There was somthing about me that just wouldn't go that extra 10% to actually eat somthing. Looked in the fridge a few times (had some good food lined up) but just never quite went all the way. It seems the LSD has that way about it. I think I started to munch at about 1 AM or somthing like that. Eating was a little bit wierd at first but the food tasted good!*****************************************************************************I recommend trying this when tripping on LSD...Listening to the following Beethoven playlist while watching BBC Life episode 1 when you're starting peak phase.  Playlist: Piano Concerto No5 Fur Elise moonlight sonata 5th Symphony Adagio Cantabile Pathetique Sonnata No. 10.  (All Beethoven)Maybe any good classical music will do it but it just seemed like these songs were perfectly suited for the BBC Life imagery. OR maybe it was just the LSD.","psychedelics","1834",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I'm copying it here as well.Let me start by saying that the experience I had with HoS from start to dropping the product was exceptional. I've had the rare pleasure of dealing with a true professional and he's got a big heart that really shines through when you speak to him.Now about the process. HoS was very communicative sometimes responding in minutes to my concerns. Very helpful throughout ordering process even agreed to do business with me privately due to my concern with the instability of the current markets.The parcel itself arrived speedily in 2 working days (including a Sunday) and was stealthily packaged the attention to detail is incredible here. I'd rate this stealth up there with Aidoneus and Righteous. Won't get into detail but I've never seen such meticulous cleverness. I'd say this was the most clandestine package i've received yet.The PRODUCT! Oh wow the product. I took two hits around midnight in a friends car left them under my tongue for a few minutes and then washed them down with some spring water. Within 10 minutes I felt the sacrament entheogen working on me. Spreading electricity through every nerve crawling up my back and raising the hairs on my neck.Halos and tracers around lights became pronounced after 30 minutes. Also kaleidoscope fractalization was present after 45 minutes. Tree limbs radiating sacred geometry and energy becomes visible to the naked eye.After about 1 and a half hours the intense OEVs had taken over my peripheral with morphing melting dripping surfaces crawling with aztec and mayan motifs and sacred ancient sanskrit seems like it was crawling over every surface.EDIT 2: Here is a good visual representation of what I perceived while I was outside:****CLEARNET LINK**********http://i.imgur.com/W1gOfgC.jpg**************************I perceived having past life memories pop up from the akashic record and downloads from the astral plane were intense and prolific. My kundalini simply exploded into the stratosphere. I felt like my friends and I were going to be abducted by aliens at points in the trip and that we had slipped into 5d consciousness.I'd like to say i'm a bit experienced when it comes to LSD as I have been in some very intense puddle experiences. Absorbing mg or more quantities of L. This was one of the most prolific experiences I've ever had with this beautiful chemical.Don't hesitate to order with HoS.

"182",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Hey guysFinally got to try some of BV's 2C-B I had ordered a while back and WOW it did not disappoint! This was my first experience with this substance so I had no idea what to expect from it other than what I had read on the forums and other drug reference sites. I took around 12-15mg after a full meal of Kraft Mac n Cheese. The first alerts of coming up happened at around 20-30 minutes when my color vision suddenly became sharp AF! Within an hour waves of euphoria began to rush over my body unlike a shroom come up there was absolutely no mind fuck or anxiety. The first OEV happened around 1-1.5hrs when faces began to morph. If any of you have ever seen the image of the woman on Tea->Coffee->Vodka->2C-B it finally made sense (If you havenât seen it check it out.) I did not get a ton of OEV but that is expected when taking such a low dose and watching TV at the same time. The thing I liked most about BV's 2C-B was the MDMA like effects. It was beyond easy to converse with my friends who were ripped out of their minds. At times they would forget I was tripping because to them I seemed so normal and the ability to form thoughts was not affected at all. Reflecting back on my trip I am still shocked how clear headed of a trip 2C-B and how gentle the comedown + after effects are. The only negative side effect experienced was a slight abdominal pain when i was coming down at around hour 6. Other than that little snafu the trip was amazing and I plan to trip on B again ASAP as it may now be my favorite drug.BV I would like to thank you for introducing me to this beautiful substance!!! You are an awesome vendor and have gained a loyal customer for as long as you stick around the market. Anyone who is mulling over the idea of trying BV's 2C-B just make the purchase you will not be disappointed. Well thatâs all for now. May your trips be merry! -BroEDIT: I suck at spelling.","psychedelics","366",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"183",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","I bought 10 tabs of Tessellated's 200ug tabs a while ago (shipping and customer support both 5/5) but I just recently got around to tripping so here's my report:I dropped two tabs (400ug) at approximately 6:00pm along with two of my friends.  I kept the tabs under my tongue for about 10 minutes before swallowing and the come-up seemed only to last 20 minutes or so.  The very first thing I noticed was a kind of vibrancy of color in the lights.  The multicolored Christmas lights strewn around the room shone darker and more intense than I'd ever noticed before.  Each individual bulb produced a tiny translucent rainbow that twinkled and danced as my eyes followed the string of lights.  We tried playing some platformer fighting games but I quickly lost interest in the game and focused instead on the brick wall behind the television.  I felt like I could feel each and every groove and divet with my mind by simply looking at the wall.  At this point we decided to set up two fans at each end of the room near the windows to try to air out the room (some spoilt milk had made its way into the room the day prior) while we went to my friends pitch-black room and chilled to music.  Suddenly and abruptly I felt a wave of euphoria wash over me and a huge grin lit up my face.  We spent about an hour in the darkness before deciding to trek down five flights of stairs to the other friend's room.  Along the way I had an incredibly intense ""hallucination"" that made me feel like I was a character in the game Dark Souls (which I had been playing a lot of recently) entering the plague-rat infested sewers.  When we made it to his room we messed around with a 24-color LED lamp.  As the lamp cycled through color after color I could feel myself being transported from vast oceans (dark blue) to the Swiss countryside (lime green) to a scene in Only God Forgives (red).  Eventually we again became restless and made the journey back up the stairs.  Of course the room had been exposed to 0 degree weather for the entire time so stepping into the room felt like Siberia.  Then I went off to my own room for a bit of solitude.  I put on some chill music and just lay on my bed tracing the outline of the various cracks on my cement ceiling.  At some point I experienced what must have been some sort of ego death: slowly the various things I self-identify with were stripped away my interface with the world was stripped away and my own consciousness was stripped away leaving nothing but a hairy ape covered in cotton staring off into space.  For the rest of the night human beings continued to disgust me aesthetically especially the entire concept of flapping meat against meat and passing air through meat to communicate.  In fact I found myself preoccupied with the general notion of communication between people.  Conversation is such a crude attempt at information transfer.  Imagine a conversation between Person A and Person B.  Person A's consciousness receives a staggering amount of raw data every second through the body's senses which must then be filtered pared down categorized and interpreted.  Only then can Person A's consciousness direct -- somewhat clumsily -- his muscles to move in a specific pattern in order to convey whatever signal or sign he wishes to convey.  Person B then has to repeat this entire process inevitably losing vast amounts of information meaning and significance in whatever piece of information Person A wanted to communicate.  The entire process is like a game of telephone played between thousands of participants happening in the blink of an eye.  How much of what happens in any given exchange of words is meaningful?  Can two people ever really be talking about the _exact_ same thing?  These thoughts raced through my mind as I carried on a conversation about life goals and direction.  By now it was 1:00am (7 hours after ingestion) and I felt like the peak was starting to disappear.  We went downstairs again to smoke a bowl and as soon as the smoke hit my lungs fantastical shapes colors and visions flooded my field of view.  The brick wall morphed into a complex fractal pattern and the wavy lines became some kind of rotating Mayan mural.  The conversation with friends unfolded into a three-dimensional array in my mind and my entire sense of audio perception was thrown out of whack.  My friends went to bed around 4:30am but I was entirely unable to even close my eyes before 10:00am (Even though I've read that dosage doesn't affect duration of the trip only intensity my friends only took 1 tab)!  I must have played ""Break from Toronto"" by PARTYNEXTDOOR over 30 times in a row (definitely would recommend for a tripping song his voice is very lyrical and complex).  Altogether it was an incredible emotional experience (nothing like I expected really even after reading dozens of trip reports) that genuinely changed the way I interface with the world.  As a lifelong introvert LSD made me feel deep empathy and connectedness with others that I haven't felt in a long time.  I'm still working on integrating the experience but already I feel more open and available both to myself and others.  I would 100% recommend LSD to anyone who hasn't tried it but is considering it and there is no doubt that Tessellated's tabs are top quality pure LSD.  Thank you so much for giving me and my friends this experience! ","psychedelics","946",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"184",NA,"detailed review/trip report: pimpit lsd","Okay - I'm officially a fan of pimpit despite not sampling his acid yet. Very funny & friendly reply from him in response to a dumb query I messaged. If business is busy that's great - competition is good and hopefully markets will thrive. Interpreting forums is like reading tea leaves. It's easy to get paranoid although that's probably not helped by excessive smoking of weed :)-Speaking of acid trips I'm not an expert - perhaps 10 trips mostly 20 years ago. Life (kids) got in the way but now I'm back with a vengeance. I recall having roughly the same experience each time from 1 tab of who knows what - just took what was offered. A fun visual trip with friends each time. I found out about SR1 and just got ready to go when that crashed. So my initial market experience was in the post SR1 market turmoil (before SR2). Anyway I bought 10 tabs from one domestic dealer on BMR before that shut down - seemed best one at time rated 150um. A couple of friends tried this (I couldn't for logistical reasons) reporting it not being very strong or inspiring (binned). Then I did a bit more research and purchased 10 tabs of 250um from a regional dealer on Agora based on a good multi-market review thread in forums. So I took one tab by myself with audio-visual set up I came up quickly (45 min) euphoric - even manic (for 2 hours) moderate visuals. But it didn't last long (4 hr max) fading after 2. Slightly anxious & restless at times but nothing serious. No hangover. A bit underwhelmed by the end. I can say I was totally over-excited by the whole event which I'm sure was a factor in the experience. I did mix it up with nitrous & grass after 2hr as the trip wore off. Shelved for later re-test.So going global now on to pimpit to be tested with friends who's judgement I trust. - I don't think I can rely on my own. By the way MDMA was a revelation to me (I missed the early 1990s - kids). Everything else pales in comparison. I wonder if that has affected my experience / attitude to acid? I'm sure a candyflip is on the cards because basically everything feels great on molly.It must be a bummer living in a region with unreliable post.

"185",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","@deadheadI have ordered from (all sr1) Tony76 peoples drug store (pre scam) goodfornothing a domestic vendor (name iI forgot) who resold supertrip's mdma schizofreen and a few other vendors I also forget their names. (Does anyone remember the german vendor who shipped mdma inside lipstick? his name was mr. xxxx?)  I liked HOS the most out of all the vendors though tony76 and schziofreen were a close second.  Tony76 might have been slightly 'stronger' per 100mg but HOS is more euphoric and less speedy. But all in all its like comparing Dom Perignon to Cristal they both are top notch and preference really comes down to the person.  HOS mdma seems a little bit more 'medical' than most brown sugar: It's really a smooth ride up and down and I never felt overwhelmed or 'fucked'. (Maybe his mdma was washed better and has  fewer vaguely psychoactive impurities)  I only say this as I actually felt that my most recent roll with HOS was my best roll better than my first roll a feeling one rarely tops. I would say HOS would compare slightly favorably (depending on personal preference) to the big European vendors Bungee etc. If you are domestic (USA) its definitely worth going with HOS.  No customs product in hand in two to three days. Tracked the whole time.Re: Stealth the stealth is amazing definitely top tier of stealth.  One Really has nothing to worry about I don't want to give away any information but product wouldn't be confiscated even if the package was opened and thoroughly searched by the  post.

Product: Tried the Shiva's before so far my favorite blotter to date!! Super potent amazing clean just overall great LSD. A THIRD of a tab will give you a nice trip. A full one is some great shit. And that price? Oh my. Far worth it. As far as the MDMA haven't tested but will soon! Will update this forum. Lost my scale but weight looks on point if not even more!! Big chunks of sticky brown-golden crystals! Before opening bag smells like inside of candy store  !!! When you open it its more like black licorice/ darker sweet smell/ rootbeer. Pretty much exactly as desrcibed and depictioned on his vendor page! ALSO: He threw me 2 Dalai Lama's!Super famous and extremely potent also have not tested but print is cool  Overall: Seriously. House is phenomenal. I will never again go to another vendor.. If you're here looking for a stable LSD or MDMA vendor who is loyal to customers really friendly super stealthy on point pays extra attention to detail and has good prices look NO FURTHER. Like why buy around from different vendors when this is the best you're gonna get? I was also venturing on these forums before.. and on the site to find a reputable vendor who seems like they care. I found them. Thanks again House not only do you provide some of if not THE best service on SR but you help enhance the quality of people's lives through these experiences which are unforgettable and 100% life changing. And you make this not only possible but super easy cheap and such a pleasure! Throughout my life I won't forget that through you whoever you are you helped me change it dramatically for the better.

"187",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","Okay so now that I learned how to be able to post here here it is my review:     This post is overdue but as with most things that I care about people’s reactions to I procrastinated. I should start out by saying that HouseofSpirit is one of the most genuine vendors I have dealt with on the darknet markets. I’ve had my share of interactions and stupid questions asking vendors to do this or that for me but HoS was more than willing to answer my questions help me out and make up a custom order for me. So as far as communication and friendliness goes I have yet to meet someone better. About his stealth it is incredible! I mean just so flawless that even someone looking for the package might confuse it. You can order with the extreme confidence that you have nothing to worry about as far as stealth goes with HoS. This vendor is the REAL DEAL.     The product. Let me say this I had never taken LSD before Friday night so I don’t have a very good comparative experience. I had always been scared to try it because of those horror stories I was told growing up about people taking one hit and tripping for the rest of their life. As a side note there was a rumor when I was growing up about one of my old high school teacher’s son who took acid and freaked out and stole some kids. How true is that story? Probably not at all.      Anyway I decided that I would not only trip on acid for my first time Friday night but that I would also trip alone for my first time (I’ve done shrooms countless times and DMT once mescaline a few times etc. but always with someone). I was scared I won’t lie. I stared at the blotters for 15 minutes not sure what to do. I looked up at the picture of my Guru closed my eyes and tricked myself into putting one Shiva Ohm blotter on my tongue. I tried to meditate but I was way too nervous. So I laid down with the movie “Home” playing. What happened exactly I cannot tell but I felt myself journey through countless lifetimes and watch the birth of endless beings on this earth. I watched the entire creation it was incredible. I almost had no idea what was happening because it felt so natural. Once the movie ended I fully realized what was happening. I was immediately filled with extreme euphoria unlike anything I can describe","the closest I could try is to say it was like feeling very close to someone you love immensely. I was lying on my floor like a puddle totally blissed out. I can only compare it to an really pure molly sort of euphoria and love but it was much more than that. For a long time I was in a position of total surrender. That was all I wanted to do surrender everything to this beautiful Infinite Consciousness. I was so full of gratitude it was hard to express it all (I tried sending a lot to HoS wherever he may be in this cosmos). I was also filled with energy I wanted to laugh and smile and dance and create. Now I’m not typically a creative person (damn science brain!) but I began writing drawing and strumming my guitar holy shit it was like an orgasm when I was strumming my guitar. I couldn’t handle it. The feel of the guitar in my hands was the best thing ever and when I strummed notes I was sent into a dimension of pure vibrational love. It was so beautiful. There was certainly a lot of morphing and melting going on","I stared at my face in the mirror as my expressions changed so rapidly without me actually moving anything. The light in my room was so radiant I stared at it for a loooong time. I was also able to really reflect on me as an individual and come to some interesting conclusions/ideas. I had no idea that the trip would be so euphoric and energetic. My past experiences with shrooms and the horror stories led me to believe I was going to go insane. After about 5 hours I started to slow down a little. My friend had suggested trying THC while on it (he’s a big stoner) so I tried but all I can say is that it put me in a weird place of feeling physically slower but mentally fast I probably will skip that part next time and save it for the very end. Then I just chilled out and enjoyed the remaining experience. I very much looked forward to going a little deeper into the hole trying two blotters.     I strongly strongly strongly recommend purchasing from HoS I have a custom order on the way. There is certainly a powerful vibration that this LSD carries because HoS loves to give this experience of consciousness to people. Intention is a very powerful force especially when combined with love. Speak love share love be love. All I can really say is thank you House. You have opened up another human’s heart to a powerful fuller dimension of being.Namaste fellow brothers and sisters!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"196",NA,"detailed review/trip report: pimpit lsd","Thanks for the report - very encouraging... now I'm fully wound up and raring to go. Is that the postman at the door?I recall pimpit indicating plus or minus 30ug variation on the indicated dosage with an aim to keep above the 200ug mark so your estimate seems a reasonable lower bound. He doubts precisionÂ  claimed by other vendors in terms of process & measurement. On the other hand tessellated seems more certain of the precision of his 200ug tabs with a discount on his 120-180 art blotter tabs due to variation (same product laid down less uniformly by someone else). So conflicting opinions there. I don't know enough about the technicalities to judge. In the end I'm a simple soul happy with a 1 tab hit to reach escape velocity (I'm assuming 200ug will do that reliably)... 750ug sounds like deep space to me. Kudos to you. Perhaps I'm just being a pussy.For some reason in my dope-infested Breaking Bad imagination I picture tessellated as Walter White and pimpit as the Jesse Pinkman of LSD.

Everytime Ive had bomb mdma its smelled just like this.Tested both with marquis and simons and both did what they were supposed to do indicating the real deal.Both were also overweight by a reassuring amount Anyone wondering whether to order from this vendor or not please save yourselves the headache and trust me on this one.. Not even joking I'm about to buy his tip listing because he went so above and beyond what I asked. Took about a week to get to me(usa) and the stealth was pretty dang cool not gonna lie Â Thanks again GFN!

I got my Jesus christs the other day...so naturally i had to have some friends over to give them a proper test run.It was my friends birthday and i busted out all my goodies for him.He was already proper drunk when he showed up to my building.so after about an hour of chilling out i grabbed some dmt for him to blast off50mg had him flying! I took some 15mb 2cb nasally. damn it burns so bad and looks so good.after a while he convinced me to give him one of those little little tabs. he never knew one little piece of paper could change his lifeSo maybe around 45 minutes of taking it he starts coming up really nice.his stomach hurts slightly but we both account that to his drinking. and the dmt.He goes on and on about how fucking strong these are. 277ug is definitely spot on!he has had those 100-110ug hoffmans before but never a big dose like this.He goes outside to smoke a cig and keeps talking about how the shadows wont stop moving and having ninja battles with themselves.Then hes just like why am i tripping so damn hard and he cant keep track of whats going on but hes handling himself nicely from my perspective.It was difficult to get him to talk about what he was seeing but he was seeing a LOT of patters constantly moving over ever surface. fractals. geometric shapes.lights flickering just outside his field of vision. kind of like a 25mg dmt dose. but for HOURS on end. he was loving it!He was talking to me and said it felt like 3 universes just being slammed down into his brain repeatedly driving knowledge of the world into his conciousness.He fried for a good 10 hours but didnt full come down until maybe hour 16 or so.very quick to warn me about how fucking strong these are and yes. he was screaming that name jesus christ! BE VERY CAREFUL WITH WHO YOU GIVE THESE TO PEOPLE!i cant wait to have one myself as ive only just had the hoffmans aswell. so a near triple dose should give me the ride of my life...might keep a xanax around just incase If they cant hang it will quickly show.NAMASTE!!!","psychedelics","380",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"202",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","I purchased some of the 140ug Swiss Xtal blotters -- I received the hoffmans across country in half a week during a time where snow delays the USPS. The stealth is unquestionably the best I've experienced in any transaction. I took 1.5 of the blotters in the morning after a light breakfast and watched Samsara during the pleasant anxiety free come up. There was no mind fuck yet just tracers and colorful outlines present in the objects I was viewing. Went outside for a smoke afterwards with some people and as we walked the perceptual clarity of LSD took over my senses leading to a different sense of humor and appreciation regarding my surroundings.Upon my return approximately 3 hours after first dosing I smoked a spliff which turned out to be a mistake. It combined with the LSD in a negative way reminding me of a bad trip months earlier on 25i and manifesting the same terrifying visuals but in a subdued manner. This put me into a state of paranoia and fear for 30 minutes or so. I went back outside and smoked a cigarette as my clarity returned to me. I was able to return to my apartment and find comfort and entertainment in my mind through the new paths of thought acid temporarily lends. It will be my final trip. 10 hours later I understood that the Hoffmans are great tabs and that the LSD was very clean there was no body load or nausea or headache but that I had finally learned all I could from the compound.Thanks BlueViking!","psychedelics","263",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Decent stealth.  Kind of disappointed.  I had both MDA and MDMA coming and I got them mixed together.  I had to try to separate them but this kind of has me peeved.I'll be honest though other than that I'm incredibly impressed with GFN's service and quality of product.  I need him to get a hold of me to help me confirm that I have it separated properly but other than that absolutely stellar in every way.I snorted 40mg of what I believed to be MDA.  in 3 minutes I could feel it coming on.  I snorted another 20mg at the 5 minute mark and another 20mg at the 30 minute mark.  I was flying good and proper.  I took another 30mg bump at 4 hours when I was still going strong and I'm very impressed.  This stuff is not only potent it has legs.When I took the bump at the 4 hour mark I also bumped ~4mg of 2C-B HCl.  Over all the night was phenomenal.  I couldn't imagine doing business with a better vendor and I'd not hesitate to order again neither would I be concerned about Finalizing Early.    I would make sure to mention to him in the address field that I want them separated though if a similar situation arose.I've rolled more than my fair share of times.  I've had MDMA from quite a few large vendors and this was incredible. I haven't rolled like that in years.  I assuming the MDMA is of comparable quality to the MDA because GFN seems to be an utter professional and seems like he truly want to help his customers.","psychedelics","284",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"204",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","Very much looking forward to hearing you elaborate on your sojourn through the cosmos DocWalt.On the Dalai Lama's I think I'm going to do some ecstatic dance/yoga and channel some serious intentional energy through my crystal/mineral collection. Might gong some tibetan singing bowls for good measure. Im just in love with the headspace on the shiva's. Making the steady ""OHM"" sound of creation I could clearly visualize the Sri Yantra formation in my mind.Extremely raw form of meditation and alchemy to tell you the truth. But in times of financial woes I will chant OM BRZEE NAMAHA. In times where I need that kundalini boost/activation/pop KUNDALINI AROHANUM. In my mind I induce alpha wave meditative states in which I envision spiritual and monetary abundance flowing into my life often on a wave of gold liquid energy. Anyone is able to do this conceptualize in concrete images of exact circumstances and ways you will manifest this energy. I always like to channel this energy into ultra realistic scenarios where I imagine every quintissential event past/present/future where I will be open to abundance. I believe by doing this sort of meditation I carve out a strong groove in my mind to attain those goals because in a way I already BELIEVE I have. We are all manifesting our own reality and in a universe of infinite possibility we are literally magicians and alchemists onto ourselves. The limits are self imposed and artificial. When arts like astral projection scrying and lucid dreaming are refined they can be invaluable although I have much energy work to do with these arts I am no master or even an apprentice simply a humble vessel. Tapping into that source energy in those meditative states is synchroblisstic! My contemporaries and I like to call these the ""downloads"".

The tabs looked great and the trip was a good one as usual.Shipping 5/5: The two tab sample of 25i-NBOMe arrived very quickly for an international order.It arrived in approximately 6 days which is much better then my average arrival time of up to 10 days in some cases for International orders. I was pleasantly surprised to see it here this early.Packaging 5/5: The packaging was very business like  clean and discreet no one to tell this apart from any other regular piece of mail I could have been receiving from the UK. The only thing I could even remotly complain about was the lack of a vacuum seal but seeing as that I have no clue if 25i-NBOMe is as fragile of a molecule as LSD is or if it even needs to be vacuum sealed. Which is why I did not hold it against him.Communication 5/5: Other then the slight hesitation at first to send me a sample because of his past experiences with sending samples and getting ripped off or never hearing back from them(which is completely understandable). There was not much communication needed other wise.Product 5/5 : I placed one tab under my lip and sat it there for 30 mins attempting to and trying very hard to not swallow any more saliva then I had to. I only took one tab because I knew that I would have work later on that day and I did not want to be totally tripped out while I was trying to do work. As the trip began the first thing I noticed was a giant wave of energy followed by a wave of happiness and well being. I let it build and build until I could not take it anymore then I walked into the kitchen and grabbed something to drink(some OJ) It tasted sort of funny and metallic so I swallowed it and put the juice back. Then I had this urge to dance (I bet I looked like some kind of an idiot doing the robot oh well lel). Then I grabbed my ipod and ran outside I skipped around town to the beat of the Beatles dancingrunning and jumping like a child watching the birds flying overhead and staring at the beautiful colors and shapes that would for in my sight. It was a really great trip.Overall 5/5: This vendor really delivered if you are looking for qualitypure NBOMe and quick delivery then this is your guy. It arrived quickly and professionally What was needed in communication was good  and the product was quality and pure which all of which provided me with an excellent trip.   ","psychedelics","531",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"213",NA,"the official lsd vendor review","Cross posting my (now complete) review for Tesselated's 200ug WoW (2 hits)Just got my package in and I'm super excited.  This is going to be my first Psychadelic experience and I'm stoked!Review:Communication: 5/5  Tess responded quickly to each of my requests very rapidly.  He's very active on the forums and while I didn't have any issues at any point during the process I know given his history here and my interactions with him that I would have been well taken care of.Shipping: 5/5 Product was shipped within a day of my order and was received 9 days after order (7 business days + a weekend). Stealth: 5/5 Tess' stealth is as good as everyone says.  I knew exactly what I was looking for and I'm still impressed by what I received. Product: -/5 Product appears exactly as described.  I have not yet taken it and won't be able to till the first of next month but as this will be my first experience I don't have anything to compare it to anyway so a numerical rating wouldn't really mean anything anyway.  I plan on writing up a trip report in this thread after taking it but I have no doubts that I'm in for a wild and enlightening ride.Overall: 5/5 I have no regrets about buying from Tess and I definitely look forward to sourcing many adventures to come from this vendor!Thanks again Tess  I'll let you know how it goes! Back for the report as promised.So I've never done any sort of psychadlic (Cannabis not withstanding)so I waffled a lot when I bought 2x200ug from Tesselated about what dosage to take for my first trip.  On the one hand it's hard to know what to expect before you experience something so I didn't want to find myself in over my head and have the trip turn on me but on the other hand you only get to do LSD for the first time once and I felt like it was important to really have a full experience.  Eventually I came to the conclusion 250ug (1.25 blotters) was a very auspicious dose it being the first dose taken by Dr. Hofmann on bicycle day. I felt it was appropriate that my first trip be the same dose as the very first LSD trip ever taken by a human being. So yesterday morning I woke up had a bowl of cereal and spent the morning doing some last minute cleaning so that the house could be very peaceful.  At noon I got out the tabs cut them apart and then cut one into quarters and placed the whole hit and the biggest of the quarters (probably about 3/8 or 1/3 of the hit) into my mouth.  Comepletely tasteless.  I spent about 10 minutes trying to get a playlist together on spotify and quickly came to the conclusion that it and google play music would be inadequate for what I wanted (my wife who has much more conventional tasts in music than I do is the primary user of these things and so I didn't already have any sort of playlists on there for myself unfortunately) and so I left my wife with some last minute instructions on what music to hunt down in the event that I became completely incapable of managing that for myself.  I grabbed some pillows off the bed and settled into the couch to watch episodes of ""How the Universe Works"" (a great documentary series in the theme of Carl Sagan's Cosmos). I definitely felt giddy 20 minutes in I was already very excited and the suspense was killing me but the documentary was good at mitigating that.  After about 40 minutes I started to notice that the room had gotten brighter and out of the corner of my eye I periodically thought that I saw the wall shift or breath just a touch but nothing much until I looked up at the ceiling.  It's difficult to say when it all started as I had turned off my phone and the documentary had been running in the background while I was cleaning  so I couldn't clearly say 2 episodes or 2.5 episodes in but if I had to guess it was about 1 hour and 10 minutes or so after dropping I looked up at the ceiling and saw that the textured white ceiling of the house was embossed with what I described to my wife as ""Paper Towel Patterns""  it was very simple at first but it slowly started expanding.  The white ceiling soon shifted or split into a two tone colorscheme with the top layer a light green and the bottom a light red.  Small black dots started to appear all over and I realized that they were mouths.  Thousands of tiny mouths began to open and close across the ceiling.  They began to move in unison a thousand tiny faces singing silently to me as the universe drifted by on the television).  I tried to explain to my wife what I was seeing I told her there were thousands of mouths on the ceiling singing to me which made her nervous  but I felt very sure that they were friendly ""They're here to help me"" I knew and said.  For the next hour my attention was split between the documentary where planets and nebula now contained myriad faces as they floated through space and the ceiling and walls of the house which were slowly being taken over by increasingly intricate patterns as millions of tiny mouths sang the song of the universe.  I was overcome with bliss. I'm not sure how long it was that I lay there but some time had passed and I decided that I needed music. While my wife wrangled a happy hardcore mix onto the chromecast I got up and watched the trees and creek that ran behind my house.  Bright purples and greens and yellows and reds melterd up and down the trunks of the trees that lined the edge of the creek and the few leaves that were left on the branches pulsed from green to red.  ""this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen"" I said to my wife as I settled back into the couch. Happy Hardcore is not a genre of music for everyone and as the first wave of synths took over it was obvious to me that the road ahead was not going to be easy.  ""This is so much faster than I am"" I exclaimed to my wife ""it definitely calls for amphetamines.""  I closed my eyes and let the music drag me forward into it's tempo.  As a kid I spent about 6 years DJ'ing happy hardcore in the local rave scene and while I don't listen to much music of any genre anymore I have always felt a certain sense of nostalgia and connection to those days; as the intensly intricate synthesizer lines rose and fell in time with kaleidoscopic fractal tunnels of infinitey I was returned to earlier times I was home. After another hour or 2 of music (wherein we transitioned to some downtempo) I was completely enjoying the carpet when my wife discussed what to do now. I told her that everything was so awesome that whatever she decided to go with I was onboard.  Being the person that she is I soon found myself cuddling with her and watching Disney's ""Mulan."" All was going well until the scene where she dishonors her family and sings a song by the river about being herself.  As silly as this sounds now I was overcome with the deepest sorrow I have ever felt.  I was completely overcome by the moment and tears just started to stream down my face.  It only lasted a few minutes and I quickly recognized how absurd the whole situation was a grown man brought to tears by a disney cartoon which helped me recover my composure and carry on with the film but I will never look at that film the same way I'm sure of that.As evening took over and the trip wound down I felt I needed to get away from the TV and spent some time in my bedroom in the dark and from there moved to a warm bath in a candlelit bathroom and arabic downtempo I found on youtube.  I emerged some time later and closed out the night with old episodes of Futurama with the wife.  All in all it was an amazing day and one that will take some time to really integrate into my life.  It was not really what I expected but I'm totally pleased with what I got.  Thank you Tess for helping me experience this. ","psychedelics","1454",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I loved the mushrooms and I also must add that I loved the fact that this vendor used a vacuum sealed bag/package which is something that a lot of my vendors I have been ordering from here lately have neglected to do. I think that it is very beneficial in keeping the magic mushies safedry and potent during and after their journey.Thank you smileProduct Quality: 5/5  They looked great at first inspection and once I tried them I found out why. They were perfect. A++ They came in 7 capsules each containing 0.5 grams as promised.Delivery time : 5/5 As I said above it arrived in 4 days which is great speed and just about the average time that it takes most of my packages from within the United States to arrive. So there is most defiantly nothing to complain about therePackaging: 5/5 It came in a regular flat rate USPS box with nothing that referenced the silkroad or anything else nefarious. You  could have never distinguish it from any other normal package in the mail. Inside of that was was an air tight  vacuum sealed (which I mentioned above made me so happy). Inside of that was a plastic zip-lock baggie which contained 7 Magic Mushrooms Capsules each containing 0.5 grams a piece as I stated above. Excellent Packaging what more could anyone ask for ++.Stealth: 5/5 Not much to say here. This was ok passable but not great maybe a little bit more effort should be put into this but in its own way the capsules are sort of a stealth feature themselves so 5/5Communication: 5/5 This Vendor was just unbelievably good at keeping the lines of communication open and making me aware at every step of the business transaction what was happening on his end. Seriously if I could I would give him a 10/5 on this one cause that is how much he impressed me compared to most vendorsMy trip was a very great one possibly one of the best I have ever had. I took 3 grams of the magic mushrooms (6 capsules) and began my trip at my TV. I watched some cartoons to compact the start of the trip Which is the part that usually gives me the most anxiety. I sat their for about 30 mins to an hour as the anxiety began to build to a breaking point. Then I stood up ran to my door shoved it open and right as I stepped outside all of the fear melted away from me. I ran up to the post office and got the mail for that day. Then I skipped over to the local store to buy some fruits and veggies. The grapes tasted so good I bought a few pounds full and ate them as I danced around in the streets. I realized that nothing could bring e down if I did not want it to not even this small backwoods town. I had all the power within me and that all humanity is worth caring about just because they are human. Even these people still deserved the human need to be cared about. I danced around in the street some more listening to the Beatles and smiling at everyone one I met. Then  I went inside and chilled with a book as the trip faded out...

"215",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","Review - House of Spirit - 2 x Ohm Shivas 150ugCommunication : Like other orders I have had from HoS doing business is just easy. No problems at all. Stealth : Puts a smile on your face every time. Like I mentioned before if you have had a package from HoS you know what I mean. Package blended in nicely with everything else. Very clever.Shipping : This one took about 5 days from what I recall which is amazingly fast considering where it’s sent from. Product : Ohms Shivas 150ug Beautiful tabs with an amazing art on them. No taste whatsoever.I put the 2 tabs under my tongue around 1850 friday night and let them dissolve while listening to some music. After 20-25 mins I could feel the glow slowly starting to hit me and 10 mins later everything started to become a lot more colorful. A sign that the the L is very good. I haven’t had L hit me this fast in a very long time. It was slightly discomforting because I had it in my mind that I had more time until the fun was to begin. I was supposed to sort a few things out before I settled into the trip but I convinced myself that I would be in for a very good ride and I could take care of whatever it was later.The come up was very clean amazing headspace and very easy to control. The colors/visuals where amazing between 1 - 1.5 hours in I felt like I had been hit in the head with a bunch of rainbows and the colors had just sprinkled out everywhere in front of me. Blinking just made it melt more. Everything had a glow about it and some of the objects in my room were pulsating. Multicolored waves and lines were appearing. I had music going from my ps3 a psychedelic mix with a screensaver of earth rotating in space stars everywhere and the sun rising and setting. Sometimes when the sun appeared from behind the rotating earth the beam across the earth would be golden then green/purple and when I stared away my vision seemed to drag the colors with it. Sometimes it seemed like the stars came out of the TV and the earth wanted to break free.I stared out of my window on occasion to see what was going on outside there was snow where I was and very colorful to. Purple tinted snow with the same glistening as the stars from the screensaver. The trees were waving to me. I wanted to go out and explore but decided to wait and chill out some more. I had another great idea and decided to raid my glowstick stash. These were in another room of my house where I apparently had left a pc running with some music on. I had had a strange sensation that the music I was listening to earlier wasn’t the only music I could hear. Now I know why music was coming from 2 places at once. I thought someone/something was playing tricks on me but it was just myself. The lights were off in my other room and now I had cracked a couple of glowsticks blue & orange and started swinging them around with a long piece of string. Tracers where absolutely mind-blowing and an intense feeling of euphoria was taking over me. I was in a great place. Spinning around myself creating what I thought was probably the best light show in the world occasionally catching glimpses of myself in a full body mirror watching myself and sometimes trying to figure out which side of the mirror I was actually on. 2 - 5 hours into the trip and I was just circling between the rooms listening to different music and enjoying everything around me. Shadows warping into figures everything was glowing and emitting an energy.At around the 6-7 hour mark it was time to go outside for a walk. Had to find some tunes I could listen to and decided on Labyrinth of your mind Vol. II. While I was checking the tracks I got mesmerized by the album cover image :<<< CLEARNET >>>hxxp://www.ektoplazm.com/img/va-labyrinth-of-the-mind-vol-2.jpgI stared into it and everything started swirling the center rotating one way the next layer rotating another. I think 3 layers where rotating and swirling altogether. Then something intense happened the whole screen became sharp and I felt like I was looking into another dimension or something and someone/something on the other side was looking back at me. The whole image was moving and becoming sharper and sharper and the eye blinked and continued to stare. Not sure how long I had contact with the image but that freaked me out lol. I still felt very good warm and safe even though something from another dimension tried to make contact with me through my cell phone ! I went with a more relaxed mix before I went outside Velvet underground Pulp Die Antwoord and some others.Headed out onto the streets around 0200 felt like I had the whole night to myself and just enjoyed about an hours walk heading in totally random directions. Sometimes I couldn’t choose and just stood still. Looking down some roads I could see beams of multicolored light flowing back and forth sometimes coming from the headlights of a couple of cars and the reflections from lamp posts and traffic lights. When I got back I hit the shower to warm up and did some cleaning that I was supposed to do earlier. Music still going in the background. Around the 8 - 9 hour mark I smoked a J that I had kept putting off. The effects were wearing down so I laid back and just relaxed until I went to sleep after about 10 hours. I woke 3 hours later feeling very refreshed with an amazing afterglow.Throughout the whole trip I always felt that warm comforting feeling. No body load. Just a lot of bliss. Colours & Visuals were amazing. I highly recommend these tabs at 300ug they really send you off to a great place.6/5 I am already looking forward to the next journey on these  definitely at the top of my listThanks again House of Spirit +1DrW","psychedelics","1044",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am not only impressed at the speed of which it arrived which was 3 business days but also that it was a gram which is really good because most of the time other vendors only send half gram samples and you can barley test the product with those.Shipping/ Packaging 5/5 : It arrived in 3 days like I said above which is just stellar in my eyes It was vacuum sealed  in 3 layers of vacuum sealed bags(++++) but once you broke open the last seal the smell just exploded from its confinement straight into my nostrils.. it also had some a+ stealth a will describe a little bit laterProduct 5/5: It looked great all of the crystals and red hairs. I rolled up a joint of it and before I could even light the joint. I caught a taste of  this very strong lemony aroma.

"220",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Hey guys I have a couple questions that hopefully you guys might be able to help and point me in the right direction.1) What is the difference between the Mayan White Czech Silver White Fluff etc. ?? I've read the descriptions and noticed that the purity is different for each one but how does the purity matter? I feel like I've read a detailed forum post on this exact question a while back but couldn't find it again for the life of me.....anyone know what I'm talking about? I mean obviously with all drugs you usually want the highest purity possible. But if thats the case why even offer tabs with 80-90%+ purity when there are tabs with 90-95%+ available? Is it just a matter of diversifying the product offerings/prices to maintain a solid customer base? 2) Is there any reason that certain crystals are laid in lower dosages? For example I usually see that Mayan White tabs are usually (but not always) in the 175ug+ range. Is it because the higher purity enables the vendor to deliver a higher quality product that is high purity as well as high dosage?Â  Â ","psychedelics","192",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"221",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Back for the report as promised.So I've never done any sort of psychadlic (Cannabis not withstanding)so I waffled a lot when I bought 2x200ug from Tesselated about what dosage to take for my first trip.  On the one hand it's hard to know what to expect before you experience something so I didn't want to find myself in over my head and have the trip turn on me but on the other hand you only get to do LSD for the first time once and I felt like it was important to really have a full experience.  Eventually I came to the conclusion 250ug (1.25 blotters) was a very auspicious dose it being the first dose taken by Dr. Hofmann on bicycle day. I felt it was appropriate that my first trip be the same dose as the very first LSD trip ever taken by a human being.  So yesterday morning I woke up had a bowl of cereal and spent the morning doing some last minute cleaning so that the house could be very peaceful.  At noon I got out the tabs cut them apart and then cut one into quarters and placed the whole hit and the biggest of the quarters (probably about 3/8 or 1/3 of the hit) into my mouth.  Comepletely tasteless.  I spent about 10 minutes trying to get a playlist together on spotify and quickly came to the conclusion that it and google play music would be inadequate for what I wanted (my wife who has much more conventional tasts in music than I do is the primary user of these things and so I didn't already have any sort of playlists on there for myself unfortunately) and so I left my wife with some last minute instructions on what music to hunt down in the event that I became completely incapable of managing that for myself.  I grabbed some pillows off the bed and settled into the couch to watch episodes of ""How the Universe Works"" (a great documentary series in the theme of Carl Sagan's Cosmos).  I definitely felt giddy 20 minutes in I was already very excited and the suspense was killing me but the documentary was good at mitigating that.  After about 40 minutes I started to notice that the room had gotten brighter and out of the corner of my eye I periodically thought that I saw the wall shift or breath just a touch but nothing much until I looked up at the ceiling.  It's difficult to say when it all started as I had turned off my phone and the documentary had been running in the background while I was cleaning  so I couldn't clearly say 2 episodes or 2.5 episodes in but if I had to guess it was about 1 hour and 10 minutes or so after dropping I looked up at the ceiling and saw that the textured white ceiling of the house was embossed with what I described to my wife as ""Paper Towel Patterns""  it was very simple at first but it slowly started expanding.  The white ceiling soon shifted or split into a two tone colorscheme with the top layer a light green and the bottom a light red.  Small black dots started to appear all over and I realized that they were mouths.  Thousands of tiny mouths began to open and close across the ceiling.  They began to move in unison a thousand tiny faces singing silently to me as the universe drifted by on the television).  I tried to explain to my wife what I was seeing I told her there were thousands of mouths on the ceiling singing to me which made her nervous  but I felt very sure that they were friendly ""They're here to help me"" I knew and said.  For the next hour my attention was split between the documentary where planets and nebula now contained myriad faces as they floated through space and the ceiling and walls of the house which were slowly being taken over by increasingly intricate patterns as millions of tiny mouths sang the song of the universe.  I was overcome with bliss.  I'm not sure how long it was that I lay there but some time had passed and I decided that I needed music.

Why I love LSD:I love to have fun on LSD however long ago the color show would often give-way to introspective looks at my life both finding flaws in my love or places where i did good . Every so often during a trip i would get a indelible moment in my trip where i knew something took place that was beyond my understanding of my self (a higher power if you will)This trip had that momentLife for many of us has been tough one hard set back after another has knocked us to the floor only to get up & face another hard trial. Sooner or latter we get tired of the fight & want to give up on being 'the nice person' & we loose sight that our life's are meant to do more than take up space here during our time here on this planet.

"231",NA,"cheshirekitty crystal lsd review","My Dearest Community.I am a newbie here on SR2 Forum but on SR1 I had high buyer statues and did well in the forums.I lost contact with my Crystal fluff supplier so i took to the darkNet to see what i could pull up.What I found was a descent amount of LSD crystal but not the purity I was looking for. i found blotters but for the quantity it was a bit pricy. I took a look around the forums on multiple marketplaces and found an interesting post by someone by the name of CheshireKitty in whichÂ  the post contained exactly what i wanted but I realized he was no vendor which startled me. i was in need of Crystal since I had run out and wasn't going to settle for less pure. So I contacted CheshireKitty asking why he wasn't a vendor and if his price was correct. I was looking for a Gram of Crystal which is what I always get. Im not short on money but my connect was gone. Cheshire messaged me back a few hours later with a bunch of information stating why he has not yet committed to being a vendor which all the things he said were very understandable since the market is unstable and with all the problems laity which I completely agreed with. Now I got in contact with him as he send me his Tor Chat and we chatted on there since it was faster. I didn't like the fact that i was going to send him 20K without Escrow which i explained. i asked about his production and everything and he was glad to answer all my questions. I wasn't going to buy any less than a gram since I would just be jewing myself. So i had to go all in. He said he would provide whatever shipping I requested which was ExpressPost with tracking. I still was wary of sending 20K worth of BTC to someone with no reviews no nothing could just take it and run but nothing about him seemed off he explained everything very business like and didn't pressure me to even buy from him. he even recommended a SR seller in which he has bought LSD blotters for testing from before thats when I realized he was legit. Even though I was scared to send that much i did at 930am aprox and he said he would have the tracking number withing 45 minutes. it was the longest wait of my life. i left Tor Chat open and around 30 minutes later my tracking number was sent to me. Again I was still wary i could just be getting nothing in the mail just a number well that was Friday I received it Monday mid afternoon when the mail usually arrives. Im based in the USA by the way so this was extremely fast shipping.I realized he had shipped it Next Day! Which was phenomenal  I got in the house and opened the package which the most amazing in genius package ive ever seen! and there it was the LSD Needlepoint Crystal In a vial with an inert atmosphere so it does not degrade i weighed it and it was 1.02 grams!! I was skeptical but trusting in Cheshire. Im extremely happy I did. That day i laid Some and tested it with a reagent kit and it was the color it was supported to be. I took 1 tab of my laid LSD and wow was it ever tasteless powerful LSD. the cleanest LSD I have ever got and I have had quite a lot. im happy as fuck that i didnt get fucked over and will always have a Pure LSD connect. To anyone who has doubts he is the real fucking deal! I may be new to SR2 but I was a Sr member of SR1! CheshireKitty has the best shit. Dont even hesitate if you have any questions feel free to ask but dont doubt CheshireKitty sick name and the best LSD ive had since the 70s. PS I will be selling some of his shit on SR soon!

"236",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","I'm somewhat experienced with psychedelics I wouldn't say a 'Psychonaut' but I have a high tolerance and can handle intense trips fairly well when compared to others at my experience level. I haven't used LSD in a very long time so my voyages with LSD were strictly on Tess's product.I'll give you general trip run downs + effects with the doses I have done.*NOTE: My and my SO mess around with other drugs particularly benzos and opiates. We are now very aware that to make the most of a trip we need to 'cleanse' our body of other brain-altering drugs like those classes. We are considering a 2 week cleanse before our next trip to see how well it goes because doing LSD even a few days after opiates/benzos the 'magic (for lack of a better word)' feeling was 'suppressed' to say the least.2 hits (400ug) (No prior benzo/opiate use)This was by far my best trip to date and the only reason was because of set and setting. It was a very euphoric night (we were very blazed) and the come up was amazing - the tingling excitement energy...we were not expecting it to feel so good! Anyway after jamming to some music we threw on the movie ACROSS THE UNIVERSE.Oh my God that movie became my INSTANT favorite go-to trip movie. The combination of music with a movie (especially The Beatles) and the sheer emotion in the movie made it a WONDERFUL 2 hours. We enjoyed the night talking watching movies listening to music. My girl put on ""Cannon in D"" and we both cried. It was a night on an emotional roller coaster but in a good way. We learned a lot about each other life and even LSD.Total trip time was around 12-14 hours. We dropped the tabs at 6pm and were baseline into our afterglow around 8am. Very obvious OEV's (breathing changing shapes waving twisting turning melting etc.) pretty extreme changes in mood (although this is an effect of LSD and obviously becomes more apparent with higher doses) SOME CEV's but I wouldn't say blatant or extravagant music sounded wonderful. Patterning like in a suede sofa or a carpet was apparent.1 hit (200ug)No CEV's at all I think at peak I barely noticed some OEV's but overall not present. Changes in emotion mood were obvious. I felt underwhelmed which put me in a sort of ""Shit there's another 10 hours of this I wish it was a bit more intense..."" mood and I've learned that sometimes just due to brain chemistry or weight some are not very sensitive to psychedelics as others are.That said it was enjoyable. I didn't 'dislike' the effects of that dose of LSD I just desired more to obtain OEV's/CEV's etc. Total trip time ~9-10 hours.2.5 hits (500ug)Very apparent OEV's and CEV's were much more abstract. Me and my girlfriend laid down a few times and got lost in our own minds with some music going in the dark. At one point she was gone for 2 or 3 hours and I went up to check on her and she said the CEV's actually led her to the most abstract dream she fell asleep (she worked a physical 16 hour shift prior) - she was stunned by the dreams and woke back up still tripping. She eventually fell asleep on the remainder part of the trip (I couldn't really blame her) but I enjoyed watching movies with a few friends and had almost the same level experience as the 2 hits except that again CEV's were much more apparent and the intensity of moods and changing of was increased a bit.Total trip time: 12 hours*Unrelated*Tried 3 hits of another supplier (which was around 350ish-420ish) we were tripping and I was not thinking straight and took 1 hit of Tess's about 2 hours into our trip (my thought process for some reason was ""YEAH LETS DO IT SON""). Total 550-600ug-ish. The prior week I had played with some opiates and benzos even the night before. Didn't even think about it until I was tripping. It took a huge edge off my trip and truthfully didn't even enjoy it - it's become apparent to me that other people experienced in these matters say that again benzos/opiates can fuck up your trip and taking tabs after you are peaking doesn't do much.So here I am. We still have some of Tess's WoW and we are going to break from other drugs and going to dose out a NICE trip very soon - As of right now I only have 4 hits for myself not sure if I should separate into 2 and 2 or say fuck it go balls deep and do 4 (3 is pointless because I'd only have 1 hit left and that does nothing for me). Either way my current minimum is 2. Once I do 4 and 5 tabs I will be able to judge better what I like.If you are a new buyer I can say this much. Don't be an idiot read and search before you ask use PGP and buy from Tess. Straight up. Tess is professional timely intelligent and handles his business like a vendor should. I have no complaints at all. So far there are two vendors in this field that truly stand out - Tess and BV. For the amount of shit Tess deals with on here he sure handles it like a pro and continues to provide a top notch product.Tess from me and my girl (and about 20 others) as always - thank you.

Decided to go tripping pretty much at that same instant so picked some of the biggest truffles and about 20g or so. Resulted in a very intense trip perhaps a bit more than expected so the trip proved quite difficult at times. Yet as the trip progressed i managed to gradually calm down a bit and from then on i just enjoyed relaxing on the couch with a real nice warm/glowing feeling coming from inside my body. Visuals were there and abstract thinking with the occasional mindfuck. 5 days later or so I had another trip. Took just about the same amount perhaps a bit smaller. I still had a bit of tolerance so the amount was just about right as I wanted it to be a bit less intense that the first one.Â  Some really nice shrooms and the vendor is both professional and seem to care a great deal about the satisfaction of their customers. Only thing I do regret though was buying such a large amount at once meaning when I had first opened the vacuum sealing they would eventually go bad - despite keeping them refrigerated. When Christmas came around I went back home to my family to celebrate and was the plan to bring the rest of the shrooms to split with some old great friends. Sadly though I forgot them when i left. When I came home 2 weeks later the shrooms had gone bad and I had to throw the rest of them in the bin. So in the future I will probably have to remind myself to stick to smaller orders or if possible to have larger orders split into smaller but several vacuum packed bags. That would be a nice service to provide Anyway NordicShrooms are definitely recommended the go-to-shroom for tryptamine trips in the EU!","psychedelics","314",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We (vendors) have been waiting very patiently for basic functions to be implemented into the site that would make what we do a lot easier and a much less stressful. These functions also benefit the customer as well. I have been patient and had faith in the staff. But now these vital functions are long overdue and have been grossly neglected. Promises are made and then broken over and over again.It's much to easy for a member to be unaccountable as there are no buyer stats. With buyer stats members build up their reputation making it easier for vendors to do business with them. Right now it's like the Wild West. People making accounts placing an order and then abandoning those accounts leaving money tied up in escrow and product out of pocket.It has come to the point where I have pages of unfinalized orders. Without Auto Finalize turned on and no Resolution Center this problem will only continue to grow worse. If there isn't a fix soon I will be pulling my listings.

I can't begin to fathom the toughts  I thought of everthing from how to acheive light speed by converting matter into light as you would a voice into radio waves  to solutions for everyday problems (I'm not even going to begin to go into details)@ 4:00 - I truly felt ""one with the universe"" I became extreamly sensitve to light & sound as they became a extention of me .Time didnt exist at all as a matter of fact ""time"" felt useless .As minutes felt like weeks the weeks broke down into indiviual seconds then split into fagments of my toughts witch exploded upon impact reflecting reality -The world was beautiful again...@ 5:30 - I could still feel a interminglment of the scences  I could feel the sound around me & See the vibrations on stationary objects.-at this point I'm hungry I didnt really eat alot prerequsite to the trip . My sitter does the obvious & calls for a pizza ...Great call bro!   @ 7:00 - have you ever watched spongebob & said to yourself...Da fuck is this ?!? It was giving me a headache to watch a neon colored sponge run around a undersea city and torment people.-Speaking of spongebob...(3 HOURS LATER) the pizza arrivedokaie it didn't accually take 3 hours haha but it definitvly felt like it !@ 8:00 - I could indefinitly feel myself floating down the latter to sobritey. Wait ?!? I'm never sober haha sooo we all deside to smoke some weed.-The weed intensified the visuals slightly we chose to vaporize it with helped me taste every aspect of the cannibis . **It was intersting worth noting**@ 9:00 - The LSD was very clean there was very little comedown even though I injested (approx 225 ug). My girl friend described it as ""gentile""-I'm not sleepy yet....Thoughhh the weed didnt help. I'm still noticing a vibrance in color along with neon black shadows that cloak every surface .@ 10:45 - Its safe to say the trip was successful I close my eyes and enjoys the CEV as the OEV as start to freak me out due to the fact I'm laying in poorly lit room -Side note...My celling fan appeared to be the ""center"" of the room(which it is)  but it appeared to be omnificent ""god like"" (thats why I closed my eyes)@11:30 - I drift off to sleep as my thoughts provoc lucid dreams-My girl friend is still awakeshe reported she fell asleep at about 12:00.Inconclusion I took LSD because I knew of its mind manifestating properties & I thought it would be theriputic to me. I honesly thought I was going to learn ""something"" from the experence . It changed my perspective more than anything the way people disbatch and receive information is what I concider thier personallity. I also have a greater resect for my surroundings  I tend to foucus on things people dont notice(usefull for problem solving). Blaze & Brandles both enjoyied thier trips as well I'm not entirly sure what they ""discoved""  but hopefully it was a positive influence on thier lifes .it has been a pleasure to write this trip report  Till next time .-Cheers Anonymous","psychedelics","1018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"243",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","Review time! I placed an order with HoS a few weeks back on another market. I am posting this here because the other markets forum is acting up and more people will read it here. Ordering & ShippingI ordered 10 Shiva ohms after reading amazing things about them here. Order was placed and sent out within a day.  Shipping was so fast I was actually surprised to see it when it arrived. 3 days from ship to delivery. You can't beat that.  Better than Amazon.com lol. A+Stealth Was the best I have seen. I have ordered from other popular sources in the past but this was on another level entirely. Very well packaged and they is no way you would know what it was unless you were looking for it. A+ProductLooked good Shiva ohm design very nice perfed blotter. Well packaged and protected.ExperienceWow where to begin…My GF and I frequent festivals in our area and a rather large one was coming up. We made plans to meet up with several close friends that we had not seen in a while and camp. Pretty much everyone in the group has tripped in the past but nobody had access to anything for this festival weekend and they seemed bummed about it. Little did they know that I had procured these Shivas and planned on surprising them as a late Christmas present. We all set up our tents and got our fire going the afternoon before the festivities began. It was a beautiful but chilly day and everyone was super happy to be there with each other. As we were chilling around our fire I told everyone I had brought each of them 2 hits of what was supposed to be really amazing LSD. Needless to say my friends were pretty excited. The five of us decided to do them that afternoon so that we would still be able to pass out at a reasonable hour and enjoy some of the daylight before the crazy party started in the evening.We all dropped 2 hits. I had only ever tripped on 150ug before this a few times so I was excited but nervous. 30 minutes I could tell something was happening. I faint tingle inside of me almost like a low electrical current running through nervous system. Visually nothing major yet. Everyone seems to be feeling about the same thing.1 hour Things are happening for sure now. The grass and leaves on the trees seem to be very very green and the ground is almost imperceptably rippling. I feel calm but very energetic. Everyone is chatting and laughing the general consensus is that this is going to be one hell of a ride. 1 -2 hours Still coming up. This is amazing. Everything is so beautiful and I am very happy to be around such awesome people. The world is very vibrant and we are watching everyone around us set up multi color tents that are rippling in the wind. I have moments of very deep introspection that almost borders on confusion. I close my eyes and the sunlight shining through my eyelids causes bursts of kalidoscope/fractal insanely colorful visuals. Waves of euphoria pass through me. I think I heard the word “wow” from all 4 other people in my group several times. 2-3 hours We all decide to walk around and use some of this energy we have. One of our group was becoming a bit overwhelmed with introspection so I figured a change in scenery would help him out anyhow.The sun is starting to set and there are other campsites and campfires everywhere. As we walked everything had a beautiful glow that was slightly covered by a intricate fractal pattern. It was awe inspiring. Music and laughter was everywhere. People were spinning fire and light poi and the tracers they left were stunning. I felt very greatful to be among so many awesome people and I could literally feel the warmth and bond that we all shared. As the sun set the clouds swirled like cream in a hot cup of coffee the colors running into the horizon like spilled paint. 3-4 hours After wandering for some time everyone was pretty much ready to head back to our camp and enjoy a little time away from the crowds of people showing up. One funny thing happened on the way back. A member of our group decided he had to use the bathroom. All there is available are Porta Potties. The blue ones… He enters and we all hang around waiting… and waiting… 15 minutes go by and we are all just standing there tripping like crazy all in our own little multicolored world. Eventually I go to see if he is ok and I hear a soft laughing from inside this blue box that my friend had disappeared into some time ago. I knock lightly and the door opens. My smiling friend comes out  and says “The things I saw in there… the universe is so beautiful!” I think our group damn near laughed ourselves to death. Luckily we were not the only tripping people at this fest otherwise we would have probably looked incredibly strange.4-6 hours Still tripping pretty hard too. Sitting around the campfire watching the flames turn into pixilated fractals. We had brought color changing packets to throw into the fire so it was violet green blue … all shifting in entirely unnatural trippy ways. So cool. I felt like I could send my mind into the fire and become one with it. The whole process of wood releasing its energy to warm the air my friends and I blew my mind. We all were getting a bit hungry so we broke out snacks. Fruit trail mix etc… The fruit was amazing trail mix not so much. At 6 hours I was past the peak and I was feeling very mellow and just enjoying my toughest and the music we had playing.6+ The come down was very gradual for everyone in the group. We were getting tired but it didn’t seem like sleep was an option. I curled up in my tent under a blanket listening to a drum circle several camps a way. The pulsing drums directly effected the waning visuals in my head and eventually around 8 hours in I slipped off into sleep. The next day I felt spectacular. Everything felt new and pure. Like my soul was washed of everything bad I had accumulated in my day to day life. The rest of the weekend was also a blast but that is another story. House of Spirit I really can’t thank you enough. Because you provide this magical gift my friends and I got to experience and see things that we will all remember for the rest of our lives. We are all closer now and I hope that some day we will all get to do this again.","psychedelics","1154",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"245",NA,"the official lsd vendor review","Two short trip reports here:1. Blue Vikings' Dali 140ug Blotter (1 tab)Setting: Bedroom/Flat with flat-mate.This was my first time dropping lsd and I've always wanted to try it so I was excited to say the least. Anywho I placed the tab under my tongue at around 12:00am and chilled on my laptop (Watching a bit of Darkside of Alice in anticipation for the effects). Around the 45 minute mark I noticed a slight tingle throughout my body now I'm beginning get excited. I decide to venture to the kitchen to make myself a sandwich and my my roomate asked me a question about something and I just ended up giggling like a school girl. So I eat my sandwich and head back into my room in which I've know got a playlist filled The Doors Floyd Jefferson Airplane Peter Green etc. blasting out waiting for the peak. Coming up to an 1 hour 30 minutes I've now got a stupidly massive grin on my face and not 15 minutes later...well...one of the most intense and amazing feelings I've ever experienced; the entirety of my body felt as if all negative energies were being drained truly an orgasmic feeling.From then on I just enjoyed the trip as much as possible. It was truly an amazing experience.2. Subtickleds' 150ug Blotter (1 Tab)Well this trip was very different from BV's Dali's.I dropped 1 tab around 11:00am and once again did some things around the flat waiting for the effects to kick in. I decided to watch Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii and towards the last quarter of the video the effects started to take ahold I started to really enjoy the music. Once the film finishes it's now coming up to about 2 hours after I dropped. I was sitting up on my bed and looked to the left at my bed sheets which had now transformed into an ocean now this puts a ""WTF...this is awesome"" smile on my face I wave my hand and notice the tracing only making my shit-eating grin so much bigger.At around the 2 hour 15 minute mark I've got my music going and I decide that I'm going to go outside and explore well first of it took me about 45 minutes to work out what I was doing everything I did seemed to make no sense and I couldn't organise myself at all. Anywho I manage to make it out the door...and I fucking wish I didn't. I'm now peaking outside in London. I begin to walk down the road passing people and I'm really trying to work out how to act normal as I've got wide eyes and pretty much everything is rippling. I get to the end of the road and decide to turn back to my flat as the experience became overwhelming on my way back I felt like my mind had completely wandered off all of these social norms that I abide by and that society has constructed have been completely disintigrated I had no connection to the outside world. But the worst of all is that I felt I completely exposed my brain and emotions to everyone around leaving me feeling that my mind had just be violently attacked by those who walked by me this freaked me out a bit. I stopped to take a few deep breaths and began to attempt to embrace the fact that I have now lost all concept of everything all things no longer had definitions to them. I manage to get back to the flat and go straight to my room lay on my bed a pull the sheets over me whilst taking some deep breaths to calm me down. About 3 hours 30 minutes in I begin to embrace the feeling of this nothingness and began to have a much more mindful trip and stayed in my room for the rest of the trip.I honestly didn't realise how overwhelming outside could be but it's all part of an experience.The difference I notice between the two tabs is that BV Dali's had a much more intense body high and slight visuals where as Subtickleds tab was definitely much more of a mentally challenging trip.Definitely enjoyed both though","psychedelics","704",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This letter sadly didn't show up but Hiniguel stayed in contact with me all the time and made clear from the very beginning that he will reship all the gear so I was ok and didn't worry at all (only because of letter could be seized but he calmed me down and said nothing was seized by EU-customs ever).After 5 weeks we both thought that the letter got lost in the postal-mess over the holidays and he reshipped. This time it went perfect and arrived after 5 working-days!I opened it (sorry I can't say anything bout the stealth 'cause my gf opened it and throws the envelope in the trash already) and what a big suprise! He reshipped more than I ordered - must be 2.5 at the minimum!!One big rock and some smaller ones","smells like C have to smell (not too strong) and the gear is Top quality for sure!! The high lasts a good hour and you don't have to snort one line after another. It's no speedy feeling comedown is not too bad and at the end of the day I fall asleep without any probs. I don't know why but this gear is the only one I tested where the nose isn't clogging as much as other C I tried at night(I have to admit I take C now for some weeks without a break so my nose is a bit suffering now so it should be normal that my nose gets stuck when I snort","but not from Hiniguel's :-) )All that I can say is that Hiniguel is a real gentleman honest generous and a guy you can trust without hesitation!!This order was one of the best in my dark-web-history and although I'm really sorry that the first letter didn't arrive the good thing in this case is that because of this no-show I can tell the community about his behavior when it comes up to work things out!Thank you very much for this experience will order again for sure!pathfinder13",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"248",NA,"the official lsd vendor review","Here's a trip report for Therapy's 180ug WoW:I took 1.5 tabs (270ug) and I've been tripping balls all day.  I generally dose in the 250-350ug range and this trip felt stronger than most.  I wasn't sure whether one hit would be enough but 1.5 was insane.  I've been off in lalaland for a solid 10 hours and I'm just now regaining enough clarity to use a computer again.  What follows is a wall of text from a rambling fool so read at your own risk!So The Dude had a plan for the day.  I was going to make some breakfast then head towards a scenic overlook across town and admire the views on LSD.  Simple enough right?  So while I'm deciding what to eat I go ahead and drop the acid ya know starting my therapy a little early.Over the next hour it's kickin' in and I decide to make a tasty pastry treat for breakfast.  I even watch a video online.  I got this no problem.  I blast some tunes and start getting everything out in the kitchen.  I'm rockin out whipping shit together it was nuts.  I don't even like to cook but I was having a fucking blast.  I started losing touch with reality all I recall was cutting things and making badass breakfast pastries.  Oddly enough I never got hungry and have only tried one of these mysterious creations so far (Time travel T+8 hours later.. it's amazing but I don't have any clue what's in it?! wtf).As you've guessed it's now 3+ hours after I dropped and I still haven't managed to leave the house.  Didn't manage to eat breakfast either and made a huge mess instead.  Blew another 20 minutes getting dressed and put on some jogging gear so I could try and make up for lost time.  Now I have no idea what made me think that jogging on LSD was a good idea or even possible but I wanted to get to my spot across town early and time was ticking away.  I look at my eyes in the mirror and they're the size of planets so I put on some shades before I go.  I crank some tunes on my headphones and I'm off.Jogging was tough at first I had to re-train myself how to breathe if that makes any sense.  But once I got it holy shit was it awesome!  It was like being in a cartoon going in hyperspeed mode.  All the colors were flashing behind me and I was running warp speed grinning ear to ear.  By the time I get to the park with the awesome view I figure out I'm the only person wearing sunglasses and it's so cloudy the sun had no chance of coming out.  Way to fit in genius. So finally I got to my spot and admired the view for what seemed like hours.  I look down and it's 5 hours in and I'm finally starting to loosely feel in control again. Still tripping big time but the mindfuck aspect was starting to wear down.  I meditate for awhile and play some mind games with the CEVs.  Then I smoke a doob and it was like turning the intensity knob to 11 again.  With each inhale everything just got wierder and wierder.  I don't remember much about that second peak but the herb really kicked it back in gear.The rest of the day I've just been coasting down nice and easy.  Trying to reflect on my therapy and piece together exactly what happened.  And cleaning up the huge mess in the kitchen.  I'm looking forward to finding out what The Dude made me for breakfast tomorrow <Update: They're Czech pastries called Kolaches and had several yummy cream cheese fillings inside.  I've since made them again but they didn't turn out as good. LSD must be the key!>  Thanks Therapy for the amazingly strong acid!  Much love and respect.","psychedelics","656",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

HOS knows what he/she is doing and is very good at it.   Communication 5/5 : HOS is very friendly and helpful. he/she always responded to my messages in a timely matter and was very accomadating. Shipping/Stealth 6/5 : shipping speed was perfect for my time quoata but honestly USPS has been slow as FUCK recently but w/e. 3 days to EC no big deal. the sealth was VERY impressive. super clever and this is what i love about HOS. it just fits so perfectly. Product 10000000/5: now for the good part  i have rolled plenty of times and have gotten some ill mdma. but this.. THIS molly was like my first time. i opened the bag (by the way HOS i LOVED the bag design :] ) and it smelt like a candyshop. it was so tempting not to dip a little then and there but i knew i had to wait. the gram weighed over by a little which is always awesome :] .so the time came to take it it was me and my best friend since childhood.. he/she has never done any drug besides smoke and drink so i knew this was going to be so funny.  i started out with parachuting 250mg and my firend parachuted 200mg. about an hour passed and i swear to god i felt it rushing in like noahs arc venturing the world. if you want a more detailed explanation of this feeling go listen to baauer's remix of you and me by disclosure. it was pure bliss. I literally was stuck to my arm chair for 30 min. my pupils were the size of quarters and i had a never ending grin. then i went to go smoke and star gaze. holy fuck the mdma was in full effect. as for my friend lets say he was lost at sea   The roll lasted for about 5 1/2 hours and i was able to fall asleep like a baby. when i woke up i had no haangover or anytihng. the only thing was that the tip of my bottom lip was chopmed off and i had cuts in my mouth. if you are one of the many reading this review im telling you DO NOT HESITATE to order with HOS. he is the perfect exmple of a star vendor and i know i can trust him/her...  to HOS: I cant wait for my tabs to come through! friday is going to be a blast :]]]]]  ","psychedelics","477",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"255",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Earlier I posted a vendor review and today I'm posting a product review.   As a quick reminder I was blown away with BV as a vendor.  Customer service levels exceed that by local vendors of local businesses in the area.  I've only purchased once but I'm already a loyal customer.This is both my first ever review of LSD and will probably be more of a trip report.  I don't know how to seperate the two.  I'm fairly inexperienced.  I'm in my 40s and while I tripped a bunch when I was a kid I don't really remember it.  I recently tripped on some stuff my local weed guy sold me but it felt very weak.  I did it three times and the third time I ate everything I had left.  I didn't prepare me in any way for what was coming.So on Thursday night I decided to take a half tab of 185ug Silver Xtal.   I wanted to start light to help be sure I'm prepared for future activities.  ""starting light"" is definately a subjective statement as it blew that other crap I bought way out of the water.  I plan to give one of these tabs to my weed guy as a gift so he understands the difference.  We're friends - I don't think he ripped me off or anything he just passed on something sold to him.  Whatever.    Anyways I dropped that half tab around 3:30.  I kept it under my tongue for a good 10 minutes before swalloing it.  There was no taste but after a minute or so it felt kinda numb under my tongue.  This may have been in my head - I don't think so but it's hard to objective about new experiences that I'm so excited about.  I first noticed an ""altering"" of my perception about 20 minutes in.  It wasn't strong.  I just noticed I was .. different.  This feeling escalated over the next hour and here things become confusing in the retelling.  Though probably sooner than 90 minutes I do know at 90 minutes I was incredibly altered.   Everything seemed .. brighter.  I as unable to filter out things that I see every day .. I'd notice my phone out of the corner of my eye and I'd have to look.  Then I'd see a book on the shelf and have to look etc.  Not compelled I could keep focus on things but this constant noticing of things was present until almost the very end.I also noticed ""trails"".  I'd move my hand and I'd see the path it took.  I had the TV on and it was hard to watch as some things (and not all which is what made it so disconcerting) would have that same effect.  I tripped mostly in my office which is primarily white walls a comfortable desk with a PC and great headphones and a big screen TV.  I didn't notice any ""bleeding"" or whatever but there was nothing I felt could have done that.At one point my wife and daughter came home unexpectedly.   WHOOPS.  They were around for 2 hours and I hung out with them.  I was able to act natural.  I feel I could have acted naturally under a heavier dose too but I've always been able to act normal under the influence of anything.  I was in GREAT spirits and we had a wonderful conversation with tons of laughing.  At one point I went to the bathroom and noticed I had huge pupils but nobody else noticed it haha.This peakish time lasted about 5-6 hours I'd say.  It ended very quickly.  One second it was there the next it was gone.  I was still ""altered"" but the trails and other changes were gone.  I was still somewhat euphoric and wound up listening to mustic on a comfortable couch in the dark for an hour or so.  Then I switched and watched Oldboy for the first time and I didn't understand it at all.  However I watched it the next day and realized I didn't understand at all because it's just a confusing fucking movie lol.So in total I had about ~11 hours of ""altered"" with ~6 hours of it being what I'd call ""tripping"".  I was INSANELY pleased with the experience and looking forard to my next experience.  I plan to take 1.5 tabs next.  I'll be alone at a hotel in San Franciso for this.  It's an amazingly nice hotel.  I'm there on business but I have a day to myself before business starts.  I'm going to start around 11am or noon.  I will walk around and check out the city go to the wharf and can always come back and hide in my hotel if necessary Let me know what you think of my review and my next step plans!  Thank you BV for being such a great vendor with a great product.","psychedelics","814",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"256",NA,"official mr. chill mushroom edibles review thread***","Taking Mr. Chill's chill pill was my first experience with shrooms. I took one last night alone having eaten about 4 hours prior. The previous night I had slept a total of two-three hours so I was pretty tired when I took the Chill Pill. I started by taking half and then the second half an hour later. It took about three hours before I began to feel the effects but felt some mild nausea up until. It was not bad or unbearable at all just a little bit of an upset stomach. Easily attributable to potential nervousness about my first trip. The effects I felt would best be described as exceptional beautiful relaxation. I had heard of people experiencing a feeling of the floor rocking or moving when on shrooms. I did not experience this but I did feel like I had some trouble with balance after getting up from a sedentary position. I experienced very few visual effects. I was viewing a slideshow of pictures on a Television and there were times when I thought I may have seen clouds slowing moving across the sky or ripples of wind blowing against a flower. But these effects were VERY subtle and I didn't see them on every picture. Eventually I decided to hop into bed and listen to a little music. Getting into bed felt very very nice. I was very aware of how the chemicals were reacting in my mind and felt waves of euphoria pulsing through my body from right to left. The music that I was listening to...it wasn't working for me so eventually I decided to turn it off and see if sleep would come. It certainly did and was dreamless and undisturbed. I slept for almost 10 hours! And felt wow just great when I woke up. All in all a great experience but I was expecting something different in terms of visual hallucinations. I have since read online that sleep deprivation prior to taking mushrooms can have an effect on the trip so I would be curious what those reading this thread know or have experienced in regards sleep deprivation. But all in all it was very nice and very enjoyable. No feelings of nervousness paranoia or anxiety.","psychedelics","375",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"258",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","So I tried out the liquid this past friday and wanted to leave a quick review. I attempted to take .1ml (400ug) but am not sure exactly of the dose I got due to what I used. But I believe it to be vrry close to 400ug.The liquid itself is tasteless. The lsd is very clean. I had zero bodyload. Come up was smooth and almost like I hadn't taken anything. At one point I wondered if maybe I didnt get as much as I planned. But then 45 min in the trip kicked in and was a happy man for the rest of the night. Great visual and audio distortion good mindfuck and extremely pleasant body high throughout the trip. Not going to go i to a long trip report bc while i had a blast-prolly wouldnt be too fun to read. But basically started the trip indoors listening to a mix of music from pink floyd to radiohead to pretty lights. Music was amazingly enjoyable. The next cpl hours were spent alone in a forest nearby. This is whre the audio distortions and mindfuck were the most prevelant. Ended up running into an old friend on my walk back home and he happened to have some nice dutch pills. Couldnt pass up the opportunity so about 6 hrs into the trip i took 1.5 superman pills and ended the night at some random persons house.Â  Not sure of the total duration sincr I dropped the x at around 5.5-6 hrs into the trip. All in all it was a very good trip off of some great clean lsd. And ay the price i got them at- its gonna be hard for anyone to beat the value of it.Â  Looking forward to many more trips w these rare mystical viking tears!

"259",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","^ Well. I won't defend this cop cuz I think he was like 99% of cops a dick. But it's the nature of the beast. He did lose his cool it seems but for the most partin terms of the coolgruff to the point character- the cop was professional. You must understand that ""being a dick"" is literally their job requirement. These peopleLE are living in a very separate reality from ours. It's very plastic and discomforting- They live with the knowledge that they are hated by ""us"" they feel polarized- many of them truly believe in what they do- that they are protectors of civility and order- helping to control civil disobediancewhich in their minds is a problem which leads to chaos. These people live in fear they believe the world is full of crazies and that everything must be controlled regulated quarantined. Seriously. So yes they carry tremendous amounts of rage and fear are likely some of the most unstable people around. They are trained to deal with hostil behaviour and have 'kill switch engage' type reflexeswhich are extremely sensitive. So it does not surprise me the way the cop got rawdy with his voice- because even the slightest resistence or warriness is perceived as a threat. Cops are trained to react to hesitency with force(verbal and \or physical) - because they see this as a potential escalation-(even though the cops' yelling is more likely to 'spook' people and cause them to flea or cower or become violent ) . This is how they are trained. They are used to dealing with gangs domestic disputes involving people who are violent and under the influence of alcohol\crack\meth\etc- so having been through these ordeals they are ALWAYS prepared for the worst- and their demeanor and protocol reflects that.    It is very sad. It's sad that we live in a world where there is so much anxiety and there is even a need for cops. Don't blame the cops. They are human. They are pawns as well. The whole system is fucked. These cops hate their jobs for the most part. Times have changed. Back in the 50's cops were abit more like a good neighbor - they would give you a ride home from the bar if you were too drunk. Now-a-days you could be stranded on a highway with your thumb out on a 105f day and unless you were appearing to do something that looked like cop- bait- they would keep drivin.      But anyway I pray for healing- and massive amounts of LSD forcefed into bodies of population at largehaha.","psychedelics","435",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Did they degrade in the mail? please let me know i'm not trying to complain or anything i just hoped to have a good trip and didn't UPDATE 2/12 I was using opiates such as heroin at the time I did not let the dots dissolve in my mouth like I was suppost to. Thats why they didn't work. Anyone else I talked to infact said they are great just low doses.

I narrowed it down to i think blue viking tesselated and House of Spirit in the end and ended up choosing HoS because they were domestic for me and seemed to genuinely care about the product as well as it being their main product and being very knowledgable. I think I made the right choice!!! communication was timely and on point shipping was quick and stealth was amazing. Really above and beyond which is great to see on top of everything else. I only ordered 5 ohm shivas and its been a long time since ive tripped and ive gone through a lot since then like emotionally so I was alittle nervous even though I'm pretty experienced with many different psychadelics. I don't know what I was so worried about this stuff was so clean and smoothe and amazing. I took it with a little bit of molly I just wish I had taken 2 at once if not more. I ended up taking about 1.5 tabs in like 2 doses. The dose seems accurate and the quality is just great. It's a day or two later now and I feel so refreshed I didn't feel really burnt out or grimy or like dumbfounded and confused where u cant talk didnt feel fried out no tension or body load issues no taste beautiful visuals and just a great experience.

"262",NA,"official mr. chill mushroom edibles review thread***","    That is a very strange trip report.  This is the first time in ten years that someone stated they had limited visuals.    This isn't LSD or Mescaline.  You can't just take 1.1g of Cubensis and another 1.1g an hour later and expect to trip hard.  Mushrooms do not work like that.    Would you split an aspirin in half and take the other an hour later?  Would you split a 500ug tab of NBOME into hour increments? NO...they're meant to be taken all at once.    I don't mean to be out of line because I'm usually pretty chill but to be honest you don't have the right to post any type of report on a drug you bought that wasn't taken CORRECTLY.  That is your fault and not mine or the drugs.  Had you taken the pill as directed (WHOLE)  when you ordered it (see listing AND my market profile) you'd have experienced the same thing all the above people did.     If you had questions about dosage you should have PM'd me.  If you had questions because it was your first time you could have PM'd me.  You didn't.    I also find it highly suspect that you decided your first post out of being new would be to come and bash my product.  I'm not calling you a liar...but if I were I'd say that you started it.   On a side note people....nausea happens 99% of the time when taking mushrooms and is completely normal.  You are ingesting a poison and your body is letting you know it...the Peppermint will do it's job accordingly and minimize this effect or get rid of it altogether.   ","psychedelics","282",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I was thinking about doing the whole 5. Only 20 minutes later I was like"" Oh Thank you for your guidance on that one.""I had been watching MTV for some odd reason. I never really watch tv. it was some old school stuff from when Jon Torz still had MTV just a moment or so before it was MTV. Anyway I used to take acid on a Saturday and spend a quiet night at home tripping with this new type of music video thing.So I am watching this last night and think I wonder what A look back there would be like?So I am tripping hard within like 20 minutes. 30 minutes in I was melting in with Michael Jackson  the Culture Club and Madness and all this weird old school new wave crap that we listened to back then.  I found myself laughing at the stupid shit I used to see in these videos. All morphing tooo hard now to be able to focus on tele.In fact my whole mind is just melting into  the most fantastic displays of psychedelic  fantasy that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. I had candycades with icing sugar tentacles and candypillars that left a strawberry trails... Oh OHHHHHI Mean just OH yes!There was no body load!Taste that you get from prints!No muck around with coming up just straight into business and still going really strong at 6 am this morning when I decide I had best be getting to bed. Try sleeping while your still tripping hard...No coming down as I sit here the cords are still wrapping around trails that lead to more visuals. After 3 hours sleep.I had a moment of introspection that may have got a little difficult but it was in general amazement at how hard I had to search for anything that was clouding my conscience. I was a clear unit and thus uninhibited by any material or Life issue/ hang ups I just traveled boundlessly.I know I broke the 500ugl barrier last night and I was wondering if we weren't looking at ~600ish ugl.Whatever it was enough.

"266",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","My experience with HoS was excellent.After placing my order for some Dalai Lamas I received a reply from HoS the following morning asking which part of the sheet I would like which I thought was a very nice touch. Shortly after I received confirmation that my tabs would be shipped out within the next day or so.The tabs arrived a few days later and were well-packed. The stealth is clever and HoS obviously put some work into it.HoS gets a 10/10 across the board.So onto the tabs...After crashing at a friend's place after a night out with some very dear friends where I ended up drinking far more than I inteded to knowing I was planning to trip the next morning I woke up early due to the trusty alcohol alarm clock. Luckily I wasn't feeling too hungover but drank several glasses of water to make sure I would be properly hydrated. I then did some stretching and meditation to get my body and mind in a good place for the journey I was about to embark upon. After getting myself all prepared I took one tab which was essentially tasteless aside from a slight paper/ink taste and placed it under my tongue and went outside and sat on a bench in my friend's beautiful yard. I sat there watching the humming birds and admiring all the wonderful flora that was growing there waiting for the acid to make itself known. After about half an hour I started to notice ""the feeling"" colors started to get a bit more vivid I started to feel a bit cold and things started to become a little odd. It had begun. At this point I decide to go back inside and lay down on the couch and covered myself with a blanket and stared out the window overlooking the yard while the comeup started to build in intensity. I could tell that these were strong tabs and that I was going to be in for a nice ride the 245ug claim is definitely in the right ballpark. After about an hour I was pretty much floored melting into the couch with a huge smile on my face feeling completely euphoric and bursting with love as I watched the plants outside glowing and pulsing. I could see into a higher dimension and see the energy fields of the plants ""through"" the walls spiraling like rainbow-colored strands of DNA. My face hurt from smiling so much! After a while my friends woke up and came downstairs and saw me layed out on the couch and with a big grin one of them asked ""are you on acid?"". All I could do was respond with a smile and a nod. She came over to me and gave me a big and most-welcomed hug then proceded to put on some Chopin which was absolutely divine. They then decided to set up a temple for me in a tent outside complete with an alter with a buddha statue and an assortment of crystals incense some old-school Indian flavored psychedelic music and lots of pillows blankets and other soft stuff. They are very awesome friends indeed.I spent what I assume to be the next few hours laying in the tent staring at the trees getting lost in a sea of fractals. I could see the holographic super-symmetry of the universe. It was like being inside a mirror-cube with one lightsource in the center projecting an image that then reflected in itself infinitely creating all of the geometry of nature. I could see how a leaf blowing in the wind on one plant directly corresponded to a leaf moving on another plant. The bidirectional transfer of energy between the earth and the sun became blindingly evident and I could see how the sun was pulling the plants out of the ground towards it down a phi spiral tunnel like slow-motion sparks of electricity.Eventually I decided to move from the tent to go lay in the grass and let the sun shine upon my body. I hadn't felt so truly grounded in a long time. I felt completely at one with the earth. I stared up into the sky watching the clouds roll by forming wonderful fractals and taking the form of buddhas with energy radiating from their chakras. At some point my friends came and joined me out on the grass and brought some food and fresh orange juice with them. I was hungry at this point but the thought of food was still a bit off-putting. Never the less I nibbled at the avocados and toast that were on my plate. After taking the first bite of bread I broke out into hysterical uncontrolable laughter. I found it absolutely hilarious how perfect the bread was never before had I taken so much pleasure in a simple slice of toasted bread. I almost started crying tears of joy. My friends all found this to be quite amusing as well.Eventually I felt the second peak hit and I went back to looking at the clouds and then it hit me. One of those huge epic visions that shook me to my very core. I could see ""past"" the sky and saw a giant zodiac rotating in the space beyond. I could see the sun as the source of reality projecting through the zodiac creating the world I was experiencing. This sent me down a spiral of thought about the archetypes and the archetypical nature of reality and eventually into deep reflection of my own personality. It was at this point that the acid made me do work and sort out some personal issues I've been experiencing lately. After what seemed like a life-time of deep and hard reflection feeling thoroughly emotionally and psychologically cleansed I was able to calm down a bit and ride the rest of the trip out chilling on the couch processing the huge data packet that had been injected into my conscious thought.Overall it was a wonderful experience that has helped me come out of a dark place I'd been stuck in for the past few months. The tabs seem to be high-quality although the body load that came with the second peak was a bit more unpleasant than I would have liked but part of this could have been because my body was still out of whack from the drinking I had done the night before. I'm excited to have another go with these tabs and share them with my friends now that I've ""calibrated"" the doses.Much love to HoS and the rest of you heads!

"267",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","Here's another trip report courtesy of The Dude.Took 2 100ug microdots this morning to assess potency.  I usually dose in the 250-300ug range so I wanted to do a slightly lower dose just to see what the microdots were like.  I love the idea that LSD is a tiny molecule that can change the world and to me these microdots embody that.  I could fit 50 microdots on my fingernail and with something so small change 50 people's lives.  I've only seen/tried blotter before so these were somewhat of a novelty to me.  I had low expectations based on a convo with Atlas and reading that microdots are low-dosed since you can't do partial doses.  Anyway on to the good stuff...I put 2 under my tongue and held em in my mouth for about 10 mins.  They lost their color and my mouth tasted like gelcap but I wanted to make sure they got absorbed.  They were still intact after 10 mins so I bit em apart and swallowed em.  Since I wasn't expecting a whole lot I figured I'd go jogging for awhile to really get it pumping through my veins.  After a couple miles I noticed my mind kept wandering and my pace was was slower than usual.  By the time an hour had passed I was definately seeing brighter colors and starting to hear audio distortion like I was in an elevator.  It got difficult to keep jogging and I started to panic but then took a step back and realized it was a good thing.  It wasn't underwhelming!The peak lasted from about an hour to 3-4 hours in and it's been gradually fading nicely all evening. The OEVs were minimal","brighter colors and glowing periphrials.  CEVs were strobing high-contrast comic book representations of things but none of the endless fractal patterns.  Had the clenching jaws and a bit of muscle tension nothing intense or uncharacteristic of LSD.  It hasn't given me any profound thoughts or amazing clarity like some experiences have.  It has left me thoroughly impressed at what you can pack into a 1mm dot though!  I'd reccommend them for when you want to have a good time rather than deep introspection.  All in all I felt like the dosage was pretty accurate.Thanks HoS!  The Dude tips his hat to you.   Looking forward to the 4-AcO!","psychedelics",392,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"269",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","I told BlueViking I'd write a review after I trudge through the 50 post process so here I am.Here is a review + trip report of mine. I love psychedelics. I have taken LSD possibly a few dozen times now. Most of which I used to get from old SR about a year or so ago. I used to take 2.5 hits of 150ug blotter and sit in the park. When I ordered it I planned to trip a few weeks down the line because that's when I expected the acid to come but it came after about a week which kind of blew my mind for my country. That was nice. Anyone who has read the reviews knows that the stealth is superb. Had a light breakfast went to the park and decided to eat one 140ug Dali/Hoffman. I'm not sure whether it was the Dali or the Hoff cos the pieces I got were dark with diamonds or something but I'm pretty sure both have the same crystal. At the time part of me wanted to take at least 2 so it would be a more 'full on' trip after not having tripped in so long and since I kind of consider myself a bit of a psychonaut but I'm glad I didn't. I don't know if it's because I've gotten more sensitive or I just forgot what it's like to tip without tolerance but it was a fair bit more intense than I remembered.Started kicking in at about the 35 minute mark and I think I peaked maybe 1.5 to 2 hours in. I got nausea when it started to kick in as I always do and it lasted about 30 minutes (Note: Like I said as *I* always do when I take LSD. This isn't a reflection of the product quality but myself. I've tripped with friends plenty of time sharing the same stuff and I'll experience light nausea when they don't.) This kind of gave me an ""uh oh maybe I wasn't as ready for this as I thought. what am I getting myself into?"" kind of feeling. I stuck with my breath and let the experience gently roll.When this passed much joy came into my being. I got in touch with my center and the rest of the experience from there to around 12 hours later when I was finally around baseline was simply beautiful. Lots and lots of joy no real body discomfort that I don't otherwise get with psychedelics. The stuff definitely feels clean and wonderful. Early in the trip I was exploring parts of my subconscious/psyche in which I felt were holding me back or creating resistance in my life. I'd decide what I want most in life and find where the dormant fear and hurt was calcified in body and mind that was stopping me from achieving those things. Things like fear in relationships feelings of inadequacy etc. As I explored and found the root of those emotional bodies I held them in my consciousness I stayed with them which was not easy and I held them in the light of pure awareness. Then in that awareness/light it became clear how irrational pointless and restraining those parts of myself which had been embedded since early life were. When these energies were met with pure love suddenly like the turning of a key I felt these energies/emotional bodies get sucked out of my body as if being pulled by a vortex to the surface of myself. As it was being pulled up it was very gross and difficult like I had to live through and experience each atom of that residual pain once more as it continued to be burned away. A purging sensation. Once it did burn I felt so much lighter. That part of me was gone for good. I felt so proud and thankful with my new sense of love for myself that I started to weep. I looked up the sky to thank anyone who may have helped me and suddenly began a chorus in the cosmic sky which extended on into a near endless ocean of disembodied loving beings all cheering with me in pure joy. Lovely to say the least. Indeed the product is good. I felt serious change from then until now and I'm really stoked because it gave me a lot of insight into how to work with fear and emotion so I'm looking forward to trying this practice again with other parts of me. I wonder if that's what they do in LSD therapy? I dono. Anyway thanks once more to BlueViking. This wizard is working some serious magic. I'm very much hoping that a similar or maybe even the same acid/crystal/dosage returns soon so I can buy it in a larger number because around 140 is the sweet spot for what I'm looking for.","psychedelics","813",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Don't swallow them as the effects are much weaker. but here let me give you a reviewRed MicrodotsStealth 10/5: Even if someone else opened the package they would never think it was any kind of drug. Shipping 5/5: I live in a far away and it took only 3 days priority way to go fast shipping!Product 5/5: I was on opiates at the time and I took 5 microdots. I still felt something but because I was high on h at the time it greatly reduced everything. Remember Don't use opiates when taking lsd or your effects will be greatly diminished. Also when taking microdots let them sit in your mouth rather then swallow instantly.House of Spirit is my only go to guy for acid from now on.

"271",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","I have been poking around these forums for over a year now and thought it was finally time to spam my way to fifty and become an active member of the LSD community here. I am so proud of what we have been able to accomplish together and the resilience our community has shown in the face of our adversaries especially that of our little tripping community within a community.Â  So without further delay I present my first review in the SR forums! BlueViking! First off I think it is absolutely amazing that we Americans have a choice now of amazing domestic vendors. There was a time not so long ago when we had to wait weeks for our letters to get here from Europe. BlueViking is quality through and through compared to any vendor here on the road but the fact that he's domestic is just icing on the cake!I ordered a ten strip of the very potent Jesus Christ tabs that BlueViking has in his arsenal right now and that are being traded elsewhere on the road as well. The speed was top notch I ordered on a Friday afternoon and they were sitting in my mailbox on the East Coast on Tuesday afternoon despite the wretched winter we're having over here. The stealth was great the outside blended right in with teh rest of the mail in my pile and the inside could legit be opened and emptied out in front of LE. I'll leave the details to leave a smile on your face when you receive your letter from BV but rest assured you have nothing to worry about. Within a few days I was able to sample the tabs. A warning to anyone thinking of trying the Christs: these are extremely potent tabs these are not beginners tabs. I have tripped probably over a hundred times but it had been two months or so since my last dance with Lucy so I was at total baseline when I dropped one tab - and let me tell you they absolutely knocked me on my ass. These tabs are NOT under any circumstances appropriate for first time trippers - if it's your first time go with another print or half a JC. My set and setting were great - at home in my apartment which is an absolute psychonaut's paradise. It started to kick after just under a half an hour and at T - 60 minutes I was tumbling waaayyyyy down the rabbit hole with a huge smile on my face. This is very visual LSD and will lead you deep inside your own psyche - the circling thoughts chasing each other back and fourth across my brain (fellow experienced trippers know what I mean :-) ) wereÂ  very very intense very introspective. This is great acid for meditation soul searching and simply becoming one with your music yourself and your surroundings. I found myself dissapearing into an alternate plane of vision very frequently - I felt as if I had lifted up and my reality splattered with color and patterns was hovering six feet above my bed - a very beautiful visual combination of where my headspace was and the music surrounding me and lifting me to a higher plane. Personally I felt a heavy-ish body load with the Christs - not unclean xtal just knock you on your ass xtal - this combined with their extreme strength would lead me not to recommend them for raves or festivals unless you are very comfortable with those surroundings and experienced with LSD. This acid is great for solitary or tripping with a very small group of loved ones in a beautiful place with lots of comforts and maybe just a tad of xanax on hand in case Jesus takes you too deep. I am so happy to be with you all here now in the forums!Love & Light-CMOS","psychedelics","652",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"273",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Posting a follow up report after trying a larger dose.  Earlier I posted on a half tab of the 185ug.  This report regards my experience on 1.5 tabs.  I'm travelling on business in San Francisco.  I dropped in hotel room around noon and immediately split. I just decided I'd wander with a general idea to wind up at the wharf. I had my phone headphones my hotel key and $40 in my pocket.  The come up was fine and that started about 20 mintes in but I found myself distracted easily. I had stopped heading towards the wharf because of these distractions and actually wandered into something of a bad neighborhood. There aren't any REALLY bad neighborhoods in San Fran but there are sketchy ones. When the peak started which went from coming up to peak very suddenly about an hour and 15 minutes in that's where I was and I was kind of freaked. A bit confused the sidewalk moving jumping away from birds thinking everyone was staring at me. Sounds awful? It wasn't. Not at all. But it wasn't good either. So I decided to go back to the hotel and hopped in a cab.This was one of the strongest and strangest parts of the day. First off this is a small boutique hotel that's french. The hallways are narrow it has an old fashioned elevator that you have to open and close the door yourself. The carpet is VERY busy. There are little knick knacks everywhere. Paintings everywhere. What should have taken me 5 minutes to get to my room I think me 15-20. EVERYTHING was moving and looked strange as fuck. It was GLORIOUS.Then I was in my room for another 15-20. I don't know how long exactly but I do know less than 30 minutes. This was the powerful part I mentioned. I sat on the bed laid down closed my eyes and BAM. IT WAS INSANE. When my eyes would close it was like this green glow came over the world that looked like what you'd see through night vision goggles. I couldn't keep my eyes closed longer than a second or two at first but I forced myself to keep them closed longer. I was seeing my room in perfect clarity by that green glow. When I would concentrate I could swing the view of the green glow ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. I am still fairly convinced it was real as I saw people and places I know. I can't describe how awesome this was.Still I didn't want to get ""stuck"" in the room so I got up and headed back out. My hotel is about 3-4 blocks from Grace Cathedral. I hoofed it up there. The hills are like literally 45 degree angles. I kept stopping and taking pictures. I'd look down the hills and by the time I was at the top I was higher than the clouds in more ways than one. I rounded a corner and saw the cathedral.  It was heavenly.  I'm not a religious person (quite the opposite actually) but it is straight up humbling. Look up pictures of the place it's amazing. As I explored the place I realized I was crying at one point. A random woman came up to me and hugged me without saying a word and started crying too. I couldn't believe it and i couldn't talk but man it connected with me in a way I still can't shake.  Then it got super awkward so I kinda beelined out of there haha.So from there I go across to a park. It's right acrossthe street from there.  I hung out there for a good hour or more. Lots of people with dogs everyone friendly just amazing.  I did a bunch more walking and saw a bunch more amazing stuff but nothing as amazing as the stuff at the up to this part.   I normally don't drink ever but I kept stopping at bars to have a beer sometimes a hard cider whatever. I didn't want to get drunk exactly but I wanted some alchohol in me so it'd be easier to sleep later.The peak ended sometime between around 7 I think. I forced myself to eat around 9 as I was STARVING but I had to force myself. I didn't want to wake up at 4am from hunger. I took a melatonin around 11pm and was asleep by midnight.I am in town on business.  I had a full business day the next day. I was down for breakfast by 7:30 and attended my conference all day. There was no hangover and it was a great day.I will wait about 2-3 weeks minimum and then hold out for however much longer for  the next ""perfect day"" to drop. Will it be right after 2-3 weeks or 2-3 months I have no clue. The stars will align for it.","psychedelics","815",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"274",NA,"gfn product review thread (mdma lsd mda shrooms foxy and more?)","I'm still very busy but much more on top of things now.  That listing you guys are talking about above was up on SR1 for ages and barely got ordered!As for that tax charge on delivery I have no idea.  I've never heard of this happening with anything I've sent before it was just mentioned here...Also I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm no longer offering XpressPost to the US.  Even though that which checks into customs continues on it's way anyway there's something to be said that nothing sent with my recommended shipping option (cheapest tracking available supposedly 9 business days once in transit but in my experience varies) ever checks into customs while it's happening more and more with XpressPost and not just from me but from other people who send down south too.  XpressPost is less used and more watched and while my customers may be OK with the risk because they want it faster this is America we're talking about and I just don't think it's worth it and would rather see everyone play it safe so I just have the $20 shipping option for USA now.Lastly I would like to kindly let everyone know that I would prefer not to be asked for tracking until 2 weeks after the order is placed by which time it will almost definitely be there by so there will be no need.  I'm not saying you can't request it sooner just that I would prefer you didn't.  Being that SR2 lacks a ""mark message unread"" button as well as SR1's bulk reply feature answering all the TN requests is slowing me down from processing everyone's orders and answering other questions in a timely manner.  If these two features were added it would make a world of difference but right now answering other message and processing orders would be a lot easier to be doing faster if everyone wasn't wanting their TN immediately after ordering.  If you trust me and you don't really need to watch your item every step of the way please hold off on asking for tracking until it's been long enough you actually have something to worry about.","psychedelics","364",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"275",NA,"cooldrugsonly official vendor review thread (usa domestic mushrooms)","Hey CoolDrugsOnly thanks for letting me try those different strains of shrooms. Sorry about coming back with the review so late.Shipping was quick and the two different strains were properly sealed and seperated. I didn't know what to expect when I looked them over. I don't have the scales to weigh them but they looked like 2 grams each instead of the one gram each you said. I could be mistaking.The P Tampenensis looked like a pile of sticks with small caps.Â  The stems were very thin. They were cracker dry so I broke them up with my fingers and washed them down with a drink. They had an after taste like shrooms and was easy to tolerate. I ate them on an empty stomach and had no nausea. The come up was smooth and I was feeling some warm euphoria after 25 minutes. For the next 2 hours I saw a lot of auras and felt great. I had better closed eyed visions with a lot of lights and fire works. At the 3 hour mark it was apparent that things were calming down so I ate the ATL #7Those had stems more like the stems of golden teachers. They were bigger than the Tamps and so were the caps. I ate no food in between these two shroom types and so when I ate the ATL #7 fruits it didn't take long to feel them kicking in. They were fresh and cracker dry and tasted fine not bad and so my trip resumed about 20 minutes after ingesting the ATL #7 shrooms and it lasted another 2 hours with an hour of come down after glowing. I enjoyed it very much. These shrooms gave me the dancing letters and waving walls. I sure appreciate it CDO and I'll be seeing you soon. I noticed you have your listings down for the time being but I will be looking for you to put them back up. One of my favorite things about eating magic mushrooms is the pain relief I get from them. I could never eat enough pain pills with my tolerance to equal the relief I get from shrooms plus the shrooms are safer in my opinion with no addiction quality and side effects not to mention they don't test for shrooms when taking a piss test.Thanks again my friend i'll see you soon.","psychedelics","397",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"276",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Joined the bandwagon and also spammed to 50 because I wanted to post my trip report of what me and my friend call ""The Trip""... Now I have done Lsd probably over 30 times maybe more I don't know for sure. NOTHING HAS CAME CLOSE TO THE LEVEL THAT I WAS ON DURING THE TRIP. I have done doses probably up too about 450-500ug. I had not tripped for a few months prior to this trip so I was at baseline. So anyways .. the package was ordered on a Tuesday and comes friday afternoon perfect:) Me and my tripping partner (J) head out into the deep country woods where he has an amazing house to trip at. I honestly do not enjoy tripping anywhere else. It is cold as fuck out so we could not go outside but I wasn't in any condition to anyways lol. We spent the entire time in his room which has a good speaker set up comfortable beds good stuff for visuals and quite a few crystals (for chakras spiritual reasons etc).We ended up taking 1.5 of the Jesus tabs. So about 270ug. We dropped and were just chilling listening to some tunes and waiting for it to kick in. About 20 min in I started to feel it..which isn't normal for me lol. I do not remember the come up very much but I remember just casually talking to J about just how hard this shit is hitting me and how fast it is coming on.. we started bullshitting and just kinda laughing at how fucked up we were for just being less than an hour into the trip. We spent sometime listening to some music just sitting in awe at how good the lucy was. This is when shit started getting real. Me and J were just describing to each other the thoughts we were having about many different philosophies about the collective consciousness and astral planes and shit like that. Before we knew it both J and I were no longer speaking to each other but more like communicating thoughts to each other ..completely telepathically. We were thinking so deep into these topics that they became the reality.. we were no longer in his room or on this earth we were in an infinite realm where huge amounts of knowledge about the universe was being injected into my brain. There was no space or time. I was no longer myself. I had a complete ego death.. there was no boundaries of self whatsoever...I was all that there ever has been and all that there ever will be. I had almost the exact feelings running through me as David Icke did on ayuhuasca. ""Infinite love is the only truth everything else is illusion"" I was no longer enslaved my the ego..I was back to where I came from. Some call it ""The source."" I do not know what to call it but there's no doubt about it that it was a more familiar than this earth. After about 8 hours total we started to come back to ""reality"" but it felt too fake to me at that point. We were mentally wiped out at this point.. pretty much all we could do is reflect on what just happened and get stoned so we could sleep. We spent the rest of our trip smoking some of the sweetest tasting cheeba I've ever smoked. Lemon Larry Og....after smoking about 4 or 5 bowls we crashed ..I woke up a couple hours later still tripping a little bit.. the wake and bake lit me right back up and I drove home with a nice lucy afterglow and a lifetime worth of experience to think about. I can no longer judge people like I used to because we are all one. I could write pages about what I learned that night just like BV said. I truly think it is downgrading the experience to put it into words.If you are ever wondering who to choose for your LSD needs. BV is the man. EDIT: I can't forget House of Spirit! Big ups to him too. These two are the only lucy vendors I have ordered through. I don't feel the need to go though anybody else.","psychedelics","710",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rather we will adopt a federated peer-to-peer method of business that is based on trust and respect. It will have a lower attack profile and as such limit communication this will be an inconvenience but will drastically increase security.It is my strong belief that the fundementals that the Silk Road is based on are sound. Tor PGP and bitcoin are secure. The fault lies in the centralization. With this in mind we will seek to deal directly with our customers in the safest possible fashion in the future.If your order was marked as shipped then it was if it was not marked as shipped then it is lost. I am sorry.This is a sad day but we will not give up.- -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)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qIA/- -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----------BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)iQEbBAEBCgAGBQJS/a6AAAoJECfs6XhJfzJiMTAH+MFOxZuZnOIUBG1cHnUDXLBHLBFLNnZOL99qFOQB68LmKJyNWGorhEK+KrgHC8kBdKhgQaONTlUoZfn7P2Z5jVfd4dtcLAb74xFgynnUYfzCPVUYTLizawhbbW3UaddOt8VjYsx8L5kVRsVgc8STdVBJ2TdyxG0+V9wsaiItA696WBntJF4pjYdqmZqk4su6oPNUfDxf3O6LVBZRSRUSZJxbT128zaI6W5qK76TVXit2Hdxcpx0jr/S0oCG5w5YokPmRRy1eRgACxnNA4rAzODrX8jVUeXxWQkoohbLbPB4YXxDBElIvMhi/mfBXvCbfTdwWprPmUrGYhCmApekH+A===P+8w-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","psychedelics","298",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Quotegoodfornothing  5.0/5 70~100 dealsOn Vacation Mode since 3 hours ago.02.13.2014 updateBefore what just happened with SR2 I was already planning to take a bit of time off from taking orders and that will start immediately. All orders already placed will still be handled. Considering major bitcoin exchanges are disabling withdrawals and what happened with SR2 the future seems unclear to say the least. If this all settles down and the security issues with the bitcoin network are resolved I should be back in business some time next week.Also if you've messaged me and are wondering if you're ever going to hear back from me my apologies for slow response times but I will have more time to answer messages during my break.Generally speaking if you've ordered something from me and you have an important inquiry regarding that order it's best to ask on the order page for that order. This way I will see it sooner because you won't find yourself at the end of a long line like you may at times when messaging my inbox. Answering any concerns relating to orders already placed is of utmost importance to me so if you use the order page you're likely to get a faster response. I ordered and FE'd on the 5th on SR2.0.  Never got a tracking number and still waiting on package. I have faith it will be here - I was also dead set on ordering a larger amount as soon as it came through. Hopefully he gets caught up and settled back in next week. Best wishes and good luck GFN.  (Also I don't think the bitcoin network was at fault here - almost positive actually - the core devs have even said tx malleability doesn't allow stolen coin - but that's for another day.)

"291",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","WOW. Thank you BV for a life changing experience. Here's a little review of what transpired.Communication: 5/5 - BV's replies were efficient and almost instant. Anything I asked - delivered and guaranteed. Shipping: 5/5 - Stealth blew me out of the water. If you don't know what you're looking for; the then the package might be tossed. Great stealth++.Product: 5/5 -  Trip peaked for ~6 hours then there were still STRONG visuals (everything was breathing) for ~12 hours or so. Slept like a baby after. Here's a short summary below.Writing this based as a 1st time LSD user.Goal of taking this: Getting an intro prospective into my life to figure a few things out.Took 1.5 tabs for BV's 185ug Mayan Whites. Took about ~30-40 mins to come up. I was watching a movie and then I started realizing ""wow this colors are amazing"". Everything got so vivid. I started phasing in and out of reality. I wasn't sure what was real or what was fake anymore. It felt a lot like lucid dreaming but I could control the dreams. I threw up because I think the body load and everything was too strong for me. (~270 ug IS A LOT for a 1st timer). Somehow I responsibly threw up in my restroom. However I didn't realize I threw up. I thought a lot of things I was doing was in my head (which was) but also I did some of the things.  Your senses get blown out of proportion. For example I thought there was liquid all over my body (which wasn't). I couldn't complete coherent setences; it was a lot of ""what just happened?!"". While some of my sober friends were there; I kept asking them what happened because I couldn't perceive what was real or not.I had a lot of dark moments and flashbacks. There were good times and a lot of bad times. But I accepted that fact and went through with it and I believe this trip gave me a clear direction on what I wanted to do with my life. All in all this trip was life changing and makes me appreciate life all the better. Thanks BV. You'll hear again from me soon.","psychedelics","368",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"292",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","     Just out of curiosity and not trying to get too deep here with specificsfor obvious reasonsahem but ...is L actually being made in the US or is it mostly Canada\Europe? I thought L production in US kinda ended after the Pickard bust. It seems damn difficult to get liscenses for the reagents and such in the usunless you got some legitimate reasons. But There is one dudeDavid Nichols who has done work with 25i-Nbome one of the few in the US- who can LEGALLY manufacture LSD. Would'nt it me the cat's meow if most of the US sourced xtal is somehow coming out of Nichols' lab(perhaps even knowingly - *hush hush* hahaha) perhaps by his underling lab assistants...who knows. But seriously it's damn hard to cook L in the us afaik. DMTshroomsweed- very doable. L ehhhh...not likely.      The whole L scene just seems so mystical and amorphous. I bet the vendors on here don't even know the cooks. And none of them actually make specific claims usually just say they ""source xtal."" They likely do the noble act of laying\dist and are connected to a large ""family""  some of whom have direct lines to the actual cooks. It's likely a large invisible international network of passionate people with the sole goal of enlightening the world. Kind of like the Bilderbergs  but doing good things    I hope my questions don't seem like I'm trolling. I would like a general overview without specifics as to the depth of it all. Because from most of my family and friends' view LSD sorta dissappered in the 90's.Like it was ubiquitous up until the late 80'safter that became scarcer and scarcer. Back in HS I was able to get tabs from 'the dude' for like $5100lots for $80-120. Now  at least in my woods it's sadly allPhenethylamines like the 2cx's and such. And these kids today call it acid! I'm appalled. I doubt many around here ever had real L.

"298",NA,"house of spirit's official lsd and mdma reviews thread.","Hello friends. Here is my late review for House of Spirit's 185ug Spongebob blotters. I placed an order with HOS after a fair amount of research and positive feedback from the community. This would be my first time taking LSD and my 4th psychedelic experience. Vendor Review:Communication: 5/5HOS is quick to respond very formal very professional very articulate and knowledgeable. These are the types of vendors I undoubtedly trust. He will send you messaged regarding the details of your order what to expect etc. Speed: 5/5Any order that takes 1 week or less to arrive at my door gets a 5/5 from me. It took 7 days exactly to reach the West Coast. Very speedy.Product: 5/5HOS truly has a magical product. The dosage seemed spot on. I did not have a test kit but with more than enough positivity and outstanding reviews I trusted his professionalism. I'd advise you always research the dosage of ANY drug before consuming something.Trip report:Â  My buddy and I planned on taking 2 tabs each while on a climbing trip in the glorious Sierra Nevada mountains here in California. After an exhausting day of hiking and rock climbing this incredible face we set up our campsite outside a lake in pure alpine bliss at about 11000'. We both dropped the tabs at about 4:00PM right before the sun began to set. Camp was set up we had everything prepared and ready for bed later so we relaxed on our sleeping pads on a rock feature next to the lake with an incredible dropping overview into what I call ""no man's land"" in the middle of the mountains.After about 30-45 minutes of us relaxing reading and talking about our lives we started to feel warm sensations pulsating through our body. At this point I was so incredibly excited and anxious. The day was already perfect and I couldn't fathom how much better the acid would make it. My friend decided we should play some mellow music to add to the ambience. At the 1 hour mark with some of our favorite bands playing off our phones we started to peak. The first thing I noticed was the music began to morph. I felt like I could audibly isolate each sound and instrument giving the music the most beautiful clarity and precision. Then the landscape in front of me began to come alive. Amazing fractal patterns and geometry took shape in the clouds and rock faces. I felt ELECTRIC. I could feel the energy flowing through my entire body onto the rock below onto the landscape before me; an incredible sense of connection to this beautiful Earth and land and it's creatures.I looked at my hands and could see the blood and veins pulsing through my fingers. This rush of energy and clarity came over my mind. All the anxiety stress soreness left me. I began to ""zoom out"" of my normal eyesight/perspective. It was like someone put a fisheye lens on my eyes. I had amazing headspace. I could recall any memory or thought and focus on it so intently that the clarity of it was almost dreamlike. I began to focus on some personal issues in my life and hashed those out for about 15 minutes. At this point *1 hour 30 min* my friend and I couldn't stay still any longer. The setting sun was giving way to beautiful pink and orange and red clouds. I was surging with euphoria and electricity. We decided to hike to a nearby rock perch to expel some energy. Climbing and rock hopping felt incredible. That same sense of connectedness took over and I could feel the energy of each rock and piece of dirt beneath me.Hiking up this small hill made me feel incredibly small but powerful - like I had the power and clarity to direct my life in any direction I wanted and I could overcome anything. I believe at this point I began to experience ""ego death."" I didn't feel like my normal self. At this point everything seemed dreamlike ( I am an avid lucid dreamer ) to where I didn't feel like myself. My name and belongings had no meaning. I was simply a beautifully complex piece of meat and bones with an amazing brain and consciousness that was puppeteering this ""body"" through the 3rd dimension. With that oversight I felt unbelievably euphoric. At the top of this rock perch we decided to lay on our backs and watch the stars. (At 11000' in the Sierras you can literally see the Milky Way and every other star...ahh) and holy shit. The stars were ALIVE. The Milky Way was so vibrant and MASSIVE. I felt so fucking small but so incredibly happy. The stars were like light bulbs flickering and moving in the wind with beautiful fractal colors behind them. This is where shit got weird.Suddenly in the middle of my stargazing (2 hours in) this intense beam of white light came from the center of where I was looking and completely enveloped me like I had stepped into a completely white room with no windows or doors. Had I died? Crossed over? I had no idea what I was experiencing but it was comparative to my lucid dreams and out of body experiences. The music could still be heard in the background but this room felt strangely warm and euphoric. I could hear the music perfectly around me at the point and the room was like a sanctuary. Then it transformed back into stars and I zoomed out of this experience. The next 4 or 5 hours were equally as enlightening/beautiful/magical/life changing. Writing this now is making me extremely emotional. I will remember that experience for the rest of my life. I can't think of much else to say other than if you're thinking about getting LSD from HOS please do it. His product truly is magical. The next few days after taking the tabs I felt GOOD. More energy elevated mood better relationship health with my family and girlfriend and I felt motivated. It was like the LSD went into my brain and cleaned all the gunk and depression and stress and anxiety out. The experience was extremely meditative and enlightening. I will be back for more HOS. Thank you and Namaste to you all!Â ","psychedelics","1054",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthermore the product checks out on presumptive tests and 100mg has me bouncing and wide-eyed just as it should.  I think I placed my order right when GfN was getting ready to take a break and as a consequence communication was a bit to be desired (not GfN's fault at all).

Other then that no way to tell it was anything illegal or suspicious at all from the packaging.Communication 5/5 : He asked me to sample a tab of LSD for him to make sure it was not ""NBOME"" and I agreed then he sent the sample simple and easy no problemsProduct 5/5 : I took the tab and it was definitely LSD I could tell by the head space that it gave me and because I just swallowed the tab and did not leave it on my upper lip for any amount of time like you need to do if it is NBOME. They only thing I do have to say is that I do not think this was 150ug I think it was just a bit less because I did not get many visuals off of this tab it could have just been me I did get a good body buzz for 9 hours or so but not many if any visuals.A bit to weak... Anyways I took the tab and tripped as me and my buddies washed a few trailers at work I was pretty buzzed and feeling pretty good most of the duration of that and had a decent time Overall 5/5: Other then the need for a vacuum seal and maybe a lowering a bit of the advertised amount of LSD Per Tab all is well with this vendor and it is no doubt pure LSD.Not to mention they cared enough after just one complaint to have the blotters tested again to make sure they had LSD in them.

My friend needed to get some cash out so we did that then came back and whacked on a film waiting in excitement. Generally it takes us both around 1 hour and half to 2 hours to peak but after 45 minutes I looked away from the tv and was hit by massive visuals it came completely out of nowhere. My friend had some slight naseua but was fine after taking a shower. Now we're not quite sure what happened between hours 1-3 all I know if having some animalistic music playing and looking at our laminate flooring having a great time enjoying the visuals and dancing.One thing I didn't realise is people have always suggested to have a clean place to trip as untidy places look atrocious these people were not wrong. I've never really noticed it on lsd before but this time I did. About 2 hours in there was what seemed to be a dead spider on the floor and this is where it got rather weird I started to see bits of dirt and squiggly lines moving across the floor and climbing the walls so I decided to exit that room and try to calm myself down. Right after that I pop to the loo and pick up a new roll of toilet paper which had blood on I looked at myself wondering if I was bleeding which I wasn't and for some reason I thought that I had blacked out and had a bloody murder on my hands - Yep rational thinking there.        I said to my friend that I needed a change of scenery so towards hour 3 we decided to go to the park across the road and climb the the top of a large hill and spent a few hours looking across the busy city and the colours were absolutely amazing.Was quite an eventful trip but definitely one I'll never forget.

I didnt want to get scammed and i didnt want to get in trouble so i did my research.  And well as you would have guessed my research lead me to House of Spirit!I originally didn't want to FE with any vendors with it being my first purchase but due to the overwhelmingly positive feedback i almost felt safe doing this on my first order with House.  House even responded to my noob PM and later updated me on the delivery date upon request.  My package arrived about a week after the initial order and i was absolutely estatic.5 ohm shivas and 5g mdma. Stealth impressed me. Seemed very believable kinda funny. The mdma was a few centigrams short but my scale isn't the best in the world so i suppose it could have been on point. Either way i was still happy as the amount was negligible.The mdma was fatastic! I have only had it 3 times prior from local sources but this stuff just somehow made me feel better. I could chill when i wanted i could dance when i felt like it and i loved everyone! My mind felt so clear and my body felt amazing! The crystals were slightly more brown than i expected from the picture but after testing it that didn't bother me one bit. Gave a friend and his girl both .14 they said they were impressed by how hard they rolled too.  The smell was interestingly strong just like licorice or anise extract. Not something i expected but as i understand safrole smells exactly like anise.I am also very impressed with the Shivas.  I have done LSD maybe 8 times previously bought locally but i would say these tabs were probably twice as strong.  I have tripped harder but on several tabs.  One tab gave me mild visuals. The carpet was forming geometric patterns trees were swaying and swirling things were more brightly colored but the walls werent melting or anything like that. The comeup was magnitudes better than my previous times.  I felt so clean. I didnt need to fiddle with something such as a cig the entire trip and my skin didnt have a certain unusual tingling sensation i got from the other tabs.  I thought alot about everything and delt with some issues that had been bothering me lately and for that i am grateful! I cant wait to try 2 No longer will i have to deal with shady people who don't even know the details of what they're selling and no longer will i have to worry about getting inferior product that has been through several pairs of hands!House is an exceptional vendor with exceptional product.  I commend him for the risk he takes to offer this kind of service to a community like this and to give people a chance to further explore their own minds.

I have never worried FEing for House not even once.Â I recently got a multitude of dots that came 20 short. We counted them meticiulously and were baffled because this simply had never happened. No one was even upset there was still more than enough to go around. Everyone was more curious about it than anything because there is usaully extra.When I voiced my concern to HoS he was too very curious about this mistake because they count them meticulously. I'm not sure what happened but I told House to not even worry about it and chalk it up to the game. Shit happens right?Well apparently not for Mr. And Mrs. House.

It was amazing to say the least. Me and John take Tess's LSD January 14th 2014•he took at 7:41 200mcg•I dosed at 7:45 300mcg•7:59 I feel slight tingling sensation in my fingers. very slight and a slight relaxation•We've been listening to Terrance McKenna with our dogs sitting beside us•These Tabs are thick completely tasteless. no bitterness in any way shape or form. •we have a good play list of music way• I do wish Sam was here.. But he can tomorrow way•as always I start flexing my ankles and trying to stretch out the ligaments and cartilage of especially my left knee right now 8:05pm• This may be placebo this soon but I feel a slight sensation right behind my eyes... It is not unpleasant.  Semi relaxing There are no feelings of Nausea as i've felt with the street LSD I've done thus far way•8:08 I feel the first ""hallucinogenic"" effects... But it is slight but definitely noticeable I need to close my eyes for a few moments. I have a feeling this is going to come on rather quickly... the feeling of SYNTHESIA is apparent... still at a very low level.. barely noticeable to the virgin user. DEFINITION OF SYNTHESIA _____is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.•SIDE NOTE. this is the most LSD I've ever taken• my colors i feel are deeper and richer in color. •John is checking out his pupils at 8:11pm • my breathing is a bit heavier at 8:12 pm•I'm going to listen to some joe rogan talk about DMT at 8:13• 31 minutes in. each passing minute has a more intense feeling. I honestly do not know what to expect. But I have a feeling it is going to be Fucking incredible on so many levels. I will swallow the tabs in 10-12 minutes •8:17 its still coming on more and more and its a great blanket of euphoria flowing over me in subtle lightly caressing patterns •I will not do this all night because again since this is a first foray into a higher dose I am going to immerse myself in the experience•8:19 I feel myself wanting to let go which I will soon. I am just wanting to squeeze as much out of my pragmatic problem solving reality as possible for recordation purposes. •8:21 John swallowed his. (8:12)•8:24 I have a more intense overall physical phenomenon my mind is still coherent though•the past minute feels like its taken about 10. so maybe I can assume my sense of time is starting to very slowly dissolve into the infinite •8:28 this is so exciting to know I am going to within the hour be in a state of mind never before journeyed into. What an awesome life experience. there is much contentness or mental serenity that can be found in psychedelics. •8:31 this is coming on about 30 minutes faster than previous trips•8:32 this has been happening for a few minutes but i can feel the wind or breath going down my throat. basically this signifies to me an initial  separation of body and consciousness •8:42 put on some Passion pit- take a walk I am grunting a lot because the feeling of greater subconscious is protruding into my now altered ""reality""•8:49 i must realize that only my MIND is being altered. the outside world is seemingly the same. But fuck my MIND my consciousness my self who the pronoun ""I"" refers to is becoming elevated •8:50 I feel like John and myself are preparing to brave the cold and the GRAY... awesome film by the way•8:56- this is a much cleaner high- if you can even call it that. I will never do regular acid again... that is a vulgarity to me now. unfortunately But it was what gave me my start so i shouldn't disrespect it too much9:11pm me and John both are now ingested with 300mcg of tessellated way•1:11AM-1:14AM- WOW after thinking I was ""coming down"" I am not. I am still fully in an intense psychedelic trip. I wish I could explain. but I was not expected to still be working at this much of an elevated consciousness for such a sustained period of time. wow. All i can think is how much more can I handle?? A lot more. ""I"" could spend countless eons contemplating the meaning of ""I"" •2:47am We me and John took a little trip in a trip into the local 24 hour bakery and got a treat. I drove. while totally on LSD. That happened but it was 100% okay however I would recommend it to a novice... which we all are. But we came back. and I am still feeling personally incredible and I literally can not wait to share this intense state of consciousness with whoever is willing to immerse themselves in it. •3:43 AM- The psychedelic stage has probably worn off.. But then again maybe not. If it has then I am currently in the most amazing afterglow that has ever existed.. I wish that I could share my current state of bliss with every human on the planet.. and animal and plant. But especially my family and the ones that I care about the most. It saddens me that like Sam says just the ever so slight tug on ""normal reality"" is too much for some people. And I honestly wonder why? That is something I need to think about some more. What makes people so scared to experience this state of consciousness? It starts with fear. at some level. •3:46 Listening to some john legend and Carlos Santana. what a mix but its very stimulating to my aesthetic desires at this point... And probably from this point on in life. John and I were just talking about how LSD which is obviously just an extension of OURSELVES enhances literally EVERYTHING in life. •4:49 AM... John attempted to sleep... THAT isn't happening. I am still in a deep state of transcendental solitude mixed with a perpetual onslaught of sensuality. That has in a way been going on all night. But as the ""trip"" winds possibly down even though I may not sleep for 4-5 more hours that aforementioned sentiment is ever present and totally fulfilling. In Every way possible. which is interesting because this feeling is in solitude but also in a platonic way with John. so multiply that with a female(s) who are experiencing and elevated state of humanity and I can only imagine how awe inspiring the shared consciousness and sentiments would become. Sexually or just communally. To end all this We were in a trip till about 7am the next morning. So basically 300mcgs of Tess's LSD will put you in a 12-13 hour timeless trip into a literal and metaphoric Euphoria. Its the only LSD I'll ever do for the rest of my life.

I have the same listing on Agora with escrow if people want thatAnyway here's another article on the medical benefits of these psychedelic mushrooms from 2005 but just do a seach for 'mushrooms cluster headaches and you'll find morehttp://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/02/health.drugsandalcohol  Headache sufferers flout new drug lawCalls for clinical trials and rethink of legislation as patients claim that magic mushrooms can relieve excruciating condition   Mark Honigsbaum       The Guardian Tuesday 2 August 2005 01.27 BST   Patients who suffer from cluster headaches - a debilitating medical condition for which there is no cure - are flouting the government's ban on magic mushrooms because they say the psychedelic fungi are the only thing to relieve the pain of their attacks.In the past two years scores of British cluster headache sufferers have turned to magic mushrooms prompted by reports from the US that suggest that LSD and psilocybin - the active ingredient of magic mushrooms - may be able to control the intensity and duration of their headaches.Although some have experimented with psychedelics before the majority have no history of drug taking. But many say they would rather risk jail than forgo a substance that lets them lead a normal life.Richard Ayliffe 39 a chronic sufferer from Dudley in the West Midlands says he has tried conventional treatments but the only thing to have brought him relief is magic mushrooms. Without them he says he would not be able to hold down a job.""People are quite sympathetic at first but once you've let them down for the third time sympathy turns to exasperation"" he says. ""Magic mushrooms have enabled me to lead a normal life.""Like other members of ClusterBusters - an online forum where cluster headache sufferers swap notes and discuss alternative treatments - Ayliffe claims that taking magic mushrooms not only interrupts his cycle of headaches but buys him longer remission periods between attacks. Some sufferers claim that since taking mushrooms they have been pain-free for up to two years.And because an attack can come at any time many members stockpiled mushrooms ahead of the government's ban this month.Last week one member of the group a 41-year-old father of two who asked to be identified only as Lee admitted he had already taken one dose in contravention of the ban.Under the Drugs Act 2005 possession of magic mushrooms is a class A offence punishable by a seven-year prison sentence. Previously only psilocybin and other preparations of mushrooms but not the fresh product itself were controlled.""The way I see it either I break the law or forgo the most effective treatment I have found in nearly six years"" says Lee.Since he began taking mushrooms a year ago he says the intensity of his headaches has shrunk by a third and the remissions between attacks have lengthened to 40 days.""It's absolutely incredible"" he says. ""I can't tell you how much magic mushrooms have changed my life.""Spurred by the cases researchers at Harvard Medical School are hoping for permission from the US food and drug administration to conduct a controlled trial.John Halpern and his colleague Andrew Sewell have collected 60 case studies from members of ClusterBusters. With the support of the Boston-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps) they plan to publish the cases in a leading journal with a view to getting FDA approval for a clinical trial next year.Maps is already sponsoring an FDA trial of psilocybin for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder.""At this stage we are not advocating anything - we're just trying to gather information and see if we can get a sense of the appropriate dosage"" says Rick Doblin the president of Maps. ""Having said that I find the anecdotal reports pretty convincing.""Cluster headaches come in cycles and are caused by a swelling of the blood vessels in the brain. Sufferers say the pain exceeds that of passing a kidney stone or of childbirth without anaesthetic.Some have found the pain which typically extends over one side of the head and face so unbearable that they have committed suicide.For episodic sufferers the headaches typically last several weeks then disappear. But in chronic sufferers - of whom there are an estimated 6000 in Britain - attacks occur daily with no more than two weeks' remission in any 12-month period. They can continue for years.Conventional treatments include oxygen and Imitex (sumatriptan) an anti-migraine medication that constricts the flow of blood in the brain. Since only two injections can be taken in a 24-hour period however this is of little use for chronic sufferers.Verapamil a calcium channel blocker can also be used as a prophylactic against attacks - but to be effective it has to be taken in high doses increasing the risk of such side effects as cardiac arrest.Peter Goadsby professor of neurology at the Institute of Neurology University College London and the world's leading expert on cluster headaches is sceptical about the mushroom therapy.He argues that the relief reported by some patients may be a placebo effect or owing to natural remission. But he does believe the cases warrant a proper clinical study particularly as ergotomine - which contains lysergic acid a precursor of LSD - has been used to treat migraines for years.""It's possible that mushrooms have some useful effect but it's far from proven"" Dr Goadsby says. ""Cluster headaches are such a devastating problem that people will turn to anything that seems to work.""But one sufferer John Hobson 36 from Barnsley in Yorkshire says since experimenting with mushrooms last year his night-time attacks have ceased and he no longer gets headaches early in the morning. But because of the change in the law Mr Hobson says he has decided to discontinue the therapy.""If I could have mushrooms growing in my garden for medical use and I knew I wasn't going to get lifted by the vice squad I would most definitely do it"" he says.""I think the government should introduce an exemption for people in need.""","psychedelics","1024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I personally engineered this blend to be a unique high energy roll. I don't get to indulge nearly as much as I used to but this fun blend is what I've been rolling lately.Every 200mg will have 155mg of MDMA and 45mg of 2-FMA. The MDMA crystal has been micronized to make a homogenous mixture with the 2-FMA powder. This blend is generally intended for someone with experience in rolling under their belt. 200mg would make for a strong experience / hard roll for your average sized male with MDMA experience. The effects of 2-FMA will kick in slightly quicker and last about an hour longer than MDMA so drop this a little earlier than you would MDMA.Many people are unfamiliar with the amazing drug that is 2-FMA. I believe it is the cleanest amphetamine out there - yes even more so than dextroamphetamine.  You'll get more euphoria focus and energy with 2-FMA rather than jitters and a ""speedy"" feeling.  For those who are curious I'm not willing to sell pure 2-FMA powder at this time. Some people classify 2-FMA as a ""research chemical"". Most RCs have a bad wrap.... and rightly so. Very few RCs have caught my attention and I think 2-FMA is a beautiful drug. That being said I still do not want to be known as a Research Chemical vendor as it might be damaging to my reputation.

"327",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Well I can say this much in my experience...as far as Tess as a vendor no qualms there. Very professional intelligent great stealth and good product.I haven't gone balls to the walls yet but I did grab up 2 x 10hit listings one in late November and one in January. My first trip was on 2 and it was absolutely amazing.After that is when I tried 1 hit. Didn't do much. Had about a month break no other things that would affect it. Like Abby I have my place set up to be optimal for tripping the way I like to. I think all of us understand that set and setting are of the utmost importance - BUT those of us who have dosed more than once or twice understand that there are general levels of effects that can be determined regardless of set and setting.I think I need to get 1 more order of Tess's stuff to ultimately make a decision on whether or not potency/dose/strength has changed from order to order - fundamentally we know batches change and that can affect things but I have heard individuals on these forums specifically say that there are stronger batches than others (obviously) and will occasionally point out to vendors that one batch was 'better' than the other..Although the most recent order (in Jan) the WoW tabs had what looked to be some discoloration we weren't sure exactly what it was and honestly didn't care. I took 3 of those and I tripped pretty damn hard but it's anyone's best guess on what 3 of those tabs is like compared to 3 of the tabs I ordered in November as they are probably from a different batch from what I can gather.Tess has a very good reputation here. I have sang nothing but he praises of Tess since I hopped aboard this train and really don't even have any reason to change that opinion...I have also tried the MDMA and love that as well. I also think that it is a good thing that vendors keep a close watch on their product and reports from those taking said product to ensure product quality - Tess seems to be on board here recognizing that there are a few people out there who are claiming that their tabs may be weakened or not up to par with what others (like myself) have described.From what I know Tess has stated in the past that they lay their own WoW and that the other tabs that were available were layed by other individuals and they couldn't guarantee dosage. That being said it is somewhat alarming that there are multiple people here (with nothing to prove really) that are indicating that their orders of T's WoW may have been either not up to dosage quality etc.Although I did order from another vendor I shall not name and 3 hits of their product were still not as strong as 2 of Tess's. The ONLY reason I even say it's worth reporting is that on my second order again the tabs were a bit discolored and there was a SLIGHT taste....was definitely different than the order from November. I have on hand various nbome's so I understand what taste differences are say between an nbome and lsd - ink can at times also cause lsd to taste somewhat bitter...but WoW? After we looked at the tabs and saw they were a bit discolored we still (didn't care) and dosed. We usually hold in mouth for 5-10 minutes then swallow - and before w/order from November there was no issue here - with more recent order the taste things was noted by 2 others but we still tripped and it was LSD - I'm almost positive of that. Who knows.As of now T's still my go-to. I am although gonna keep an eye out and see how others who order from him report - or I just may wait until they finish out their stock and replenish and go from there.","psychedelics","672",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

He does a service to humanity by providing these drugs and I hope he never has to worry about finances because he works too hard to make his customers happy.PS buy the fucking Viking Tears!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","psychedelics","223",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is no use screaming and shouting just be patient and after that if it does turn out he as royally fucked you over you can say your peace and go elsewhere. This is drug dealing people just a heads up its not the most stable of business ventures and things always fuck up. A lot of people have faith in him and it would be retarded to burn everyone yet still stay around to hear all the bullshit.

"332",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","So it's been a long time since my order but I said I would review sooner or later so here it is. This was my first psychadelic experience and I took it on alone. I did it outside in some nice plains at the middle of a cold winter night. I dropped it at around 11:00 and it started coming down at 5:00. The comeup was magical and when it was kicking in hard I would look down at patches of snow in the grass and they would take on patterns of fractals and the branches on the trees around me started drooping. Most of the visual effects surprised me a lot but the best part of it all was that I brought along my phone and headphones packed with my favorite music. I listened to some albums which happened to be psychadelic music and I understood some of it for the first time. All the while I was walking around and getting lost. After a bit of music it became almost too much there was no fear and I'm very glad for that but there was a lot of confusion. I called up a friend to talk and ended up going home to relax. I tried going to bed and it felt like all the blankets in the world wouldn't have any effect on me. It was easing up so I decided to just go on my computer for an hour until i could sleep.I wish I could put everything I felt into this story but all I can say is I dived into something unconcerned about whether or not I was prepared. I got lost I got confused and then I caught myself. I learned a lot from it and I felt greater than I ever had. To talk about the actual product though it was clean white tasteless and it came on real smoothly. And it was definitely strong as hell. I'm looking forward to buying it again soon and giving it a second go maybe even with friends. Thanks a lot Tess","psychedelics","346",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"333",NA,"**hiniguel uk review thread** pure meth peruvian cola - bulk dutch mdma +  lsd!","I just spammed all the way to 50 so I could post here because I think that there are a few things that need to be addressed by Hiniguel. My last point in particular has not been mentioned before.Firstly I've been buying on SR for 2.5 years to Aus and have had a lot of success and been scammed many times this is a new account because I haven't had any need to post on the forums since they were reset but if you care to jump on IRC there will be some regulars who can verify I'm legit.I currently have an order with Hiniguel at about 40 days. My package definitely did not arrive and a reship was promised. I take offense to being called a scammer (which you have definitely done by claiming that the majority of the no shows are scams - I'm one of them) and this is the first thing that rang alarm bells for me. This belief that your customers are scamming you goes hand in hand with the practice of selective scamming a particular community to get even.The second and most important thing that worries me hasn't been mentioned yet:Hiniguel believes he has just seen a massive surge in aussie scamming and has brought in his new aussie policy requiring insurance. This is fair enough what is extremely strange is that he would then immediately waive his new policy. There is absolutely no logic behind this if you believe Aussies are scamming you then holding this sale and including aussies is just asking to get scammed again.The only way this move makes sense is if those orders are never going out in the first place.If you think we're scamming you then stop sending to us or impose whatever restrictions you need to for Aussies. However to say we're scamming you and then hold a sale which makes it easier for you to get scammed is completely nonsensical.I'm not saying Hiniguel is scamming us I'll withhold judgement on that until I see if my reship arrives. He does need to manage this better because right now something definitely smells.I haven't left feedback on SR because I want Hiniguel to have time to sort this out before I commit permanent feedback. I'll be happy to come back and eat my humble pie and say I was wrong if the reships arrive.","psychedelics","396",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"334",NA,"official mr. chill mushroom edibles review thread***","I got my order in early Feb but I wasn't able to try it out until last weekend. This was my first time with shrooms but I have tried lsd. I took one at 8:30 pm. Even with the reviews here I really couldn't imagine how the chocolate would mask the shroomy-flavor much but it really did. It was barely noticible at all! I had a pretty large meal at dinner but within 30 minutes I was already feeling it. At about an hour and half I was really in full swing. There was so much energy and I just had a grin the whole time. I started watching a movie while it was kicking in but every few minutes I would get up and decide to do something else for a while. I was using my chromecast and I found the nice pictures that it shows when it loads up were more interesting the movie. Even though I know they were not animated I could see swirling water and waving trees. Somehow I was able to get music going for awhile.The highest point in the trip lasted about 5 hours. Even after that my thoughts were very smooth and happy. I was even able to interact with people. Normally I find that with LSD dealing with people is too much. But with these I just wanted to cuddle and talk!My only regret was only ordering a 2 pack. I will back for more!","psychedelics","244",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"335",NA,"the official lsd vendor review","BrotherI had the most profound experience Friday night.Oddly enough when I first popped the tabs under my tongue it tasted of weed for some reason. Probably something just in my head... After a about a minute it became tasteless as usual lol.I decided to trip with a new friend that I had met a few weeks prior. He was tripping on a 200ug tab from Tessellated. And we were doing this shared experience via Skype.I have been dealing with a few major life events over the past year and just have been reacting shitty to them so I haven't been mentally healthy to be honest.During the first two hours it was amazing I was enjoying music pictures and the overall experience of things starting to breathe.Towards the peak I started becoming disconnected with myself again and allowing the drugs to take over. At some point I had flash backs to my previous horror trip and became fearful of my drug use. It felt like I was out of control of my body again... but my friend pressed on and kept trying to coach me back into a positive place.He kept telling me to focus on positives and to regain my confidence and to truly believe in the choices I was making with my life. He was stating that he was so glad we connected because I had helped him in a major way in reconnecting with others (he's been socially closed for about a year). For some reason during this part of the trip I was just not proud of my drug use and he exclaimed ""then toss your drugs feel proud feel liberated. Do whatever it is that makes you happy go take a shower."" It was at this time that I decided to toss all of my drugs because in this moment I wasn't proud of them lol. (Slightly regretting doing so now haha as I do want to experiment on LSD a bit more in the future after some theraputic mental counseling).So I somehow made it to the shower in my uncontrolled state and smiled as the water hit me and I cleaned up from the day's work and dirt.That smile/shower changed my world. After I got out of the shower I turned off my music and turned off all the lights in my room to get away from all the distractions that were clogging my brain and not allowing me to be in control and it was at this point that I HIT THE MOST PROFOUND experience of my life.I found true happiness inside. I found that confidence I once lost. It was at this point that I learned the powers of LSD for theraputic use. It showed me that I don't have to hold onto all of this anger hate and sadness I cling onto. I fucking danced to music for the first time in my life and let loose. My friend and I connected on a ""soul mate"" level (just not in a ""gay"" way lol). It was absolutely beautiful and he's recommending me to get back into mental therapy to help deal with some of the things I've clinged onto - as he has and he states that it's really helping him stay positive on a daily basis.The come down was also just as amazing. I was able to have clear thought and memories were able to process at such ease. I seriously wish I could feel that total confidence happiness and clear mindedness at every moment. I think I can achieve this by making some better life choices and reacting to things I can't control in a more positive way.All in all this was an AMAZING experience and I would not have been able to have it without your existence. I really appreciate everything you and your team do to provide the freedom of choice in what we want to ingest into our bodies and minds.Thank you!","psychedelics","655",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"336",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","I ordered from Blue Viking last week and thought the service meritted a decent review never properly reviewed drugs before so here we go.Have ordered 5 100mics (was just short of coins for the double dropped) gummy sweets late on Monday afternoon I was shocked by the speed of shipping when they showed up very discreetly the stealth was very convincing on thursday to the UK.Saturday night I was away back home and with my friend we used to do a lot of psychedelics together we decided to dive straight in with 2 at roughly 9pm.They seemed to kick in really quite quickly in under an hour we were both standing muscles and joints feeling that lovely body load and tension that I always find particularly pleasant from LSD.An hour or so in the conversation picks up and we are both constantly on the edge of giggles. Cracking jokes and talking nonsense is coming very naturally and we are both regularly breaking down in fits of laughter.We had a small amount of butane hash oil so we are dabbing a bit which seems to compliment that acid really nicely.My friend had an 8th of what is arguably the worst coke I have ever seen (and coming from the UK we get some stupidly shit coke on the street) it took just one line for me to realize that I wasn't going to want any more at any point but its so shit that it seems impossible not to derive comedy from the absolute nothingness that this coke does when it hits your nose.The visuals really pick up and everything is pleasantly warping I'm getting a bit nostalgic being back home and am very much enjoying looking out the window.This 200mic dose blows 2 100mic drops of Jesusofraves TOC liquid out the water in terms of potency. 2 drops of that stuff didn't have me tripping anywhere near as hard.We decide to half the last one (not sure if there's any point halving one but we went for it anyway) and we return to talking nonsense.After 4 or 5 hours our friend who isn't tripping has to go to catch his bus so its just the two of us we are both quite spaced but still quite chatty.About 6 hours into the trip my friend received a phone call from a guy who he'd been in a fight with which was all a bit strange but as my friend's a fairly seasoned tripper he managed to hold it together and avoid any sort of conflict (which the dude on the phone seemed to be wanting) which did put a dampener on the experience but it was still fine even after that we were still able to enjoy ourselves.Roughly 8 hours after starting tripping I left to go home it was a 40 or 50 minute walk so I stuck some tunes on the ipod and really really enjoyed walking home.Everything was glistening and shadows were moving around it was excellent. I felt lovely and was very comfortable in my body feeling a bit creaky as I always do on hallucinogenics always reminds me of the rejuvenative effect I get from acid.I had to stroll through a reasonably sized park at one point and was really loving the wide open green space and the trees.When I arrived home despite being fairly tripping still I downed some niacin (which I've heard can kind of chill it out but seemed to do nothing) and was still able to fall asleep fairly easily.The next day despite having only slept for maybe 4 hours I still felt excellent and fresh experiencing that brilliant ""brand new"" feeling I tend to get post trip.An excellent purchase and am glad to see that this LSD was as strong as it was as so far the LSD I've bought on the road has not been anywhere near as strong as what I used to get on the street.Cheers","psychedelics","658",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"338",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Note: I wanted to do a review for my purchases for a while but it took me a bit to get situated and out of noobville. Sorry for taking so long! I also wanted to wait till I made a few other purchases to compare the products and experiences with other vendors! Now... This is a review for Tess. Do I need to say much? Â  But if you are thinking twice about buying from him JUST DO IT! He is definitely one of the best vendors here!However...I'd like to start with how great this vendor was. It was my first purchase here on Silk Road 2.0 and I have been trying to get real LSD for a while so I lurked around the board and the market for about 2 months and the only vendor that stuck out was Tessellated. The first time I saw his listings I immediately thought ""This is the guy I want to order from!"" because the first time I looked at his profile he gave off a very professional feeling and made me feel confident ordering from him. Also a quick forum search on this guy revealed to me he had a very helpful and nice presence. He just seemed like a down to earth honest vendor.Communication was awesome. Straight forward answers and quick replies. He even asked me If I wanted to know what to look out for in my mail! Very helpfulWhat did I order? 5 hits of clean and potent LSD (200ug) for a price of $72Once I received my product I was ecstatic! It was like being a young kid under a Christmas tree on Christmas morning all over again! The blotters were white unperforated blotter tabs with I think looked like pencil lines drawn to show you where to cut to get an even dose. It gave off a very nice home made look to it! Although I had a good amount of experience with NBOMe I decided to only swallow one tab to test the water first. For my first trip on LSD I decided I was going to do it alone in my room watching a movie! I decided to put on Alice in Wonderland (1951) to watch because I have a feeling every user of psychedelics at least watched that movie once while on acid and I wanted to experience it to see what all the fuss what about(believe it or not this was actually my first time watching the movie as well!). I swallowed the tab and started the movie and didn't feel any effects for about 30 minutes. There was no feeling during the come up whatsoever. But around the time the cheshire cat appeared was around the time I started feeling a little happier. Everything just appeared to be hilarious! I was laughing to the point where tears were coming down my eyes this is the first time that happened in a long time! Sadly visuals didn't start to appear until the movie was over but I'm glad that's when it started to kick in because the visuals made it hard to focus on my monitor. Once the visuals started kicking in I realized how intense this experience was really going to be! My mind started racing and everything was morphing and expanding all while an electric looking green aura outlined every object and kept pulsating. At this point I decided to lay on my bed listening to Pink Floyd's Meddle album (my favorite Floyd album  ) and laid back looking around my dark room. I looked at my posters hanging on my wall and all I could see was the face of the cheshire cat appear on them! It was an awesome thing to realize how much certain things you see or do during the come up (or before) can have an influence on the trip! After looking at the posters I decided to stare at my ceiling for a bit and well... my ceiling looked like it disappeared! Like it turned into a portal to another world! I saw what looked like these black figures dancing like how you would at a ritual around a bonfire these figures looked like stick figures from cavemen drawings! They were all just dancing around the outline of my ceiling it was awesome!I should also say something about the closed eye visuals because these were the most intense closed eye visuals I have ever experienced! Once I closed my eyes it would be pitch black for a second or two but then it seemed like my eyes reopened and I would see these blue and black geometrical shapes flying towards me and creating the same geometrical shape again but far away but it would fly towards me again. That's the best I can describe it I'm sorry if that was a shitty description but it is easily compared to those optical illusion GIFs that you would find on tumblr or something. Now the thing I would like to mention is my headspace felt very 'heavy'. Like my mind had trouble trying to complete a thought it was a very mindfucked trip. During the middle of my trip I tried my hardest to think of something but all I came up with was something about horses riding spaghetti noodles....It was definitely my favorite experience in my life and completely changed me for the better! I'm normally and introvert reclusive type person with high anxiety but after this experience I no longer feel as much anxiety as before and I find socializing isn't all that bad anymore! I talk to more people and I feel very content with myself I also look at myself and I like myself now. This substance and experience really did improve my life and I owe Tess a lot of thanks! If anyone read this completely I thank you as well! Thanks for reading my first review on SR2 and my first trip report! Hope everyone enjoys their experience with this LSD as much as I did.","psychedelics","1006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"339",NA,"what its like to date a transgender. also 32 hit lsd trip report open mindedness","I just thought id share about my personal relationship and sex life on here. It all started in September when I met a beautiful and unique looking girl online. After I fell in love she told me she was transgender and by that point I was in love enough that I didn't really care and I was bi curious anyway so who cares right? So I met her in person she could've done a better job shaving (seriously bush is NOT attractive) but eh I love her so I was ok. She asked me to grow a bush and I refused because my balls started itching when hair grew. So we got some Chinese and went to her place and after kissing/cuddling I felt her dick (it was smaller than mine even though she said on the phone she was bigger. lol she had to admit mine was thicker) and so I had this urge to suck hers. Which I did. It tasted like really salty and vinegary. I had to spit it out it was soo bad. But it was still cool sucking her off. Then she sucked mine and I tasted some of mine strangely it was mostly tasteless only slightly salty not too bad.Then we took lsd and I took Viagra to last for hours and started fuckin her in the buttLeave a comment for PART 2 ill write it if youll read it!PART 2 okay so after I fucked her in the butt we went to her friends house where the lsd kicked in. That's when shit got weird. We smoked some weed and it made the lsd kick in instantly. Talk about a head rush man. I took 32 hits and I believe she took 6. even with my lsd tolerance. 32 blew me out of the water and fucked me up. We were all sitting around laughing when I lost memory. The rest of the story is what im told I did. I apparently hit my girlfriend in the face with my palm pissed on the floor and got naked and made really demonic unusual sounds. I also tried to scare her friends autistic brother who screamed ""get away from meee!"" and then they beat me up for that. I apparently then got kicked outside in the snow where I passed out for some time and they believed I died or froze to death but they were all tripping so who knows if I was ok or not. I had mild frostbite not too bad. I apparently then busted their door down breaking it and then my girlfriend said we had to drive to her house. I backed into a street pole damaging my car. We had to ask her friends for a ride which they did. when we got to her house she explained that at some point I had grabbed her and dry humped her. I apologized.Currently we don't talk much even though she asks how I am sometimes. Ive found a NEW transgender and on Saturday were gonna drink blueberry vodka.

"344",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","I've been following the last few posts. I totally agree. I had one rougher experience with Tess'tabs and it was not his LSD- it was my preparation that was off. It resulted in a trip that was achy and I had allot of chest tension. This is almost always due to improper eating habits and exercizelack of sleepetc BEFORE the session. (going on a tangent here...warning!)   And yes I truly believe a purer temple also results in much more intense trips. I've found lately that I can have incredible trips10 hours full on just 150ug. Most of my friendswho are toxic- full of nicotinealcoholand years of drug abusematerialistic lifestylesstresspoor sleep habits- they don't trip as hard as me. They do not see or feel the things I do. It's very clear when I talk about my experiences- the cascading and flowing mandalas opening and closing on sidewalksbeveled\embossed images on my body of exotic animalsalien creaturesarcane languages- the lacy digitized fracturing of spacewhere my whole field of vision is cut up into fine cheesecloth like ribbons of colored bandseach spiralling into infinity- they just look at me and say 'how much acid did you eat bro!...I never seen THAT shit.'    And from the reviews I have readmost of you DO have intense visual\sensory trips like mine. So I think allot of it has to do with the whole body\mind complex. What you are aboutwhat you are made of- your imagination.    In some ways I feel LSD can only magnify one's latent creative potential. Pretty much everyone here on this forum who takes LSD is here for a reason. We love what LSD does for us. It opens portals.     But for the masses that don't know much about LSD like allot of my college frat buddies- they see acid as just another druganother high. So when they take acid they get just that-another high not much else. A body buzz they giggle- maybe they see some walls breathe that's about it. They just don't GET what acid is all about.    I feel that this general perception is why acid is viewed by Legislators as a narcotic- in the same category as crack\cocaineHeroinand Meth. It's ""just"" another nasty street drug that causes people to fuck up and be out of control. That's the general view. And allot of my friends WANT just that- to get 'lit up' to get 'wasted.'    The irony is that the few friends that I've turned onto LSD in a sacred\shamanistic setting- dim lightingmantra musicincenseetc- had profound experiences very visual\mental\sensual  and their preconcieved ideas about LSD were totally shatteredalong with their egos.    BUT they were also OPEN to the experience and allowed for the possibility that everything they were told about LSD was embellished or just straight up lies.    They all came out of it changed for the better    ","psychedelics","481",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I did that and went to bed to sleep thinking ""if I trip I trip if i don't atleast ill have some nice dreams!"". So with that mindset I fell asleep for about 40 minutesand woke up feeling a little weird then I put some headphones in and I realized I wasdefinately tripping a little! smoked a joint and then bam started recognizing the geometricalpatterns everywhere music was amazing had an awesome walk with an amazing eupgoric cleanvibe.I went to the grocery store and that was around 3am smoking a joint and having an awesome time withcrazy cool OEV this is the crystal that gave me the most geometrical patterns (my all time favorites!)I was able to talk normally to the cash register and bought some cigs and sat on thegrocery store front where they had some colorful chairs for sale right next to somebeautiful flowers I just sat back and enjoyed the awesome colors and shifting.Walked back to the house and passed a cop on the way which didnt scare me nearly as thoughtit would!After all that I sat on my front porch listening to pretty lights and watchingmy lawn and the tree sillouettes moving beautifuly while thinking about life all the stuffI take for granted it made me realize a lot of things.After a good two hours of that I went inside took a crazy shower and felt SO clean on pointrenewed I felt like a million bucks!After the shower I went and laid down with my SO and I felt just pure love like my soul was made tobe with that person forever i felt EXTREMELY connected to her (think those couples paintings by Alex Grey).Trip lasted the usual 8-10 hours for me. Relaxed to try to sleep listening to some rebelutionand went to sleep with nice colorful CEV.All around great trip and great product have been getting raving reviews from everyone Igave these out to.Good vibes to all you fellow heads out there for making this community awesome!

"351",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","I think this is a very interesting topic. I myself used to have nasty habits. Smoking weed pretty much all the time that took me into excessive binging of pizzas chips you name it. I had it. After my second trip on lucy I gradually felt the need to smoke decreasing. Until last week when I literally had some kind of food poisoning the day after. Couldn't eat for two days and been eating fresh veggies and fruits ever since. Not only that to prepare for my trip on saturday I cut on meat completely.Then came saturday when I dosed 400ug on Tess's pure magic tabs with my buddy. This time not only did the acid hit me 20 mins faster it literally changed my life and the way I look at nature people and most importantly myself. A liberation of one's self. I've never felt so gracious for the fresh fruits and vegetables the Earth has to offer us. Which is the reason I change my diet into fruits & veggies (including on the side nuts fish) at least a couple days before my trip to prepare.I'm also curious as to what people look at if anything when they trip. For me it was an image of the galaxy (wallpaper on Mac) that literally blew me away so much I could not stop tearing because of the sheer beauty that hit my consciousness. The universe was spinning the stars shining and I had never seen the constellations so clearly. Definitely looking forward to look at a real clear sky one night!Â ","psychedelics","262",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

So I was afraid to take second tab I guess. bcs I dont wanna going to the moon   I mean I feel just 150 ug no more or no less as adversited. I felt the effects about 9-10 hours.

"353",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Just wanted to drop my review in about the custom house line. two tabs @ 150ug each here was the result. Obviously nothing but good things to say about the stealth timeliness all that is excellent so this mainly just deals with the trip report itself:I set out by myself in my room. Music on nothing to do the next day. I carefully take out two of the 150ug white house customs. Unsure of the blotter art it is some kind of cartoon but I can't make out what the drawing is of. Wondering if I'm going to get too deep I decide to take two anyway and just ""let it flow"".The first hour was filled with pretrip anticipation. Some sweaty palms a little tension in the body but I always carry around a certain amount of body-load normally so I wasn't sweating it. Definitely just the reminder from my physical body to take better care of myself. Knowing I'll be up all night I have a cup of coffee before any of the effects come into play and put some MiHKAL on the sound system.A friend drops by and I wander over to his place to smoke a few cigarettes. We talk for a while the effects are starting to come on strong. I talk about what I am seeing the patterns and OEVs just starting to edge there way into my existence. After a few minutes he asks about something something and I invite him over and gift him his first experience a white mayan looney tune print.We part ways for a little bit I hang out at my place listening to music. The walls are not just moving they are alive and dancing and pulsing. There is something special about this batch I like the headspace it feels ""cleaner"" than the silver czech (which I still had a BLAST on!).After my last trip I cleaned the entire apartment with rubbing alcohol and it looks spotless. I prefer a totally clean environment when tripping otherwise I get drawn into the dirt/gunk/funk of reality. The visuals from winamp are popping off the screen spiraling around the room. Colors are brighter I can barely talk.I go and visit my friend he's just starting to come up and is laughing insanesly. I mean like a mad man. We sit and laugh and laugh about the obsurdity of being ""down the rabbit hole"" and I take the time to explain to him a few things about Family and generally just bring him gently into the fold. This is his first experience and I want it to be good.Around 12:30 we get hungry and we decide between the two of us we can handle a trip to the local store. We get there and it is pouring down rain. There are an unusual amount of people hanging around for this time of night but maybe it's normal. We walk through the mini mart grabbing sandwhiches drinks and some more smokes. I head back over to his house and I empty half the pack of smokes on the table with stern instructions ""These are for you... I'll be back in 30 minutes to check on you!"" as I just needed some me time to listen to music. He is laughing and chain smoking and overjoyed at the world. I quiet him down a little at this point it's maybe 2:00 am and we're both soaking wet from the walk to the store.The apartment complex we live in is staffed at all times so to go out and return we have to navigate the front desk staff. We're both way too high for this but we do it anyway. We smoke outside and talk and laugh. He finally gets how deep the rabbit hole can go. At this point he wants to take more. I explain the diminished returns but he's really wanting to ""go deep"" so I let him have another tab. I know it won't get him any higher but it's his first time and he wants to prolong the experience I can't blaim him. I decide not to take any more as 300ug is about what I can handle and I already know it's going to be a LONG night at this point.At some point we split off again I like to spend an hour or so at a time with company and then I just jam out to music by myself let myself go deep and then meet back up. Kind of like surfing the waves. I head downstairs to go outside and smoke and my spidey sense kicks in. My friend is at the front desk moon pupiled talking to the front desk staff and making no sense. I give him the ""get the f'ck outside"" code look and he just waves me off. No worries I know if he goes off we're in a safe place so I let him continue ""his adventure"" and let him make of it what he will. I step outside and the ground is moving in waves and patterns mosiacs the concrete has turned into a flowing river of colors. The trees sway. It is pouring rain still but it is wonderful. The city seems to be unusually wide awake for ... is it 3 am now? Yep.I head inside and my friend finally makes it back to his room so I don't worry about him. I walked over checked on his status and turned some music on for him and told him it's a good time to listen to tunes and go deep. He does and I return to my apartment to do the same.Visuals and all are ON until 10-11am even throughout the day I catch small little movements waves tesselating patterns. The walls look like minuture vessels carrying life plasma flowing through them. The artwork in my room seems to bleed off the canvas and flow onto the walls around it. I spend some time online looking at cool pictures of visionary art animals and other spectacular imagery. It's all fully alive fluid moving. I am convinced I am telepathically communicating with aliens from another planet that I am indeed ""one of the aliens"". This isn't the first time this has occurred on a good trip for me but this trip just reinforced it. There are higher intelligence lifeforms and altered states of consciousness is how they enjoy communicating information to us about higher realms.Throughout this whole time I'd take 10-20 minutes at a time to explore the closed-eye visuals and they were all bright and neon like lots of psychedelic inspired imagery just beautiful flowing nameless shapes and colors. It was amazing.All in all I would be comfortable exploring this crystal/lay in even higher doses which is a big sign of endorsement. As I mentioned in my brief review it really does seem ""BLESSED"" in some way. Just clean no body load and major major journey potential.Not something to be taken lightly but definitely a POWERFUL spiritual tool. All in all glad I have a few left for next time I need to squeege off the 'ole Third-Eye again. Overall dose: 300ugDuration: 10-12 hours of steady tripping afterglow of about 4-8 hours. Still in the afterglow really and that's almost a full 24 hours later.Body load: Minimal if at all. Definitely can highlight existing body tensions but that's to be expected. Didn't add anything or create any additional tension.Was a wonderful time.

"354",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","This is my report for the Silk Road 277ug White print!I received 2 of these tabs from trivia! incidentally this is the first item I've ever received from BV though I've much admired his/her/their operation since SR1.The only tabs I've had from SR are Jannis's Dolphins (both the 100ug and 140ug prints) and Tess's WoW. These silk road prints definitely have their own unique feel. I would say they are more like the dolphins in that there is an insanely orgasmic body high during the peak. The energy of Tess's WoW tend to be for me more localized in my head.Â  All three are beautiful.I took one tab and I'm about 8 hours since dosing as I write this.The sheer synchronicity of this whole experience amazes me. I had forgotten about the contest when first I'd read it announced but I randomly jumped online at the right time to see the trivia question. Before I jumped online I hadn't even the slightest thought let alone plan to take one of these tabs and then 4 days later I'm placing it on my tongue. There were times during the trip that I just held my head in sheer awe of how any of this came about as it did.trip bits:The come-up was smooth and easy. First effects noted at around +00:30 min (I held the tab under my tongue for 20 minutes before swallowing). When I first place it on my tongue I noticed the slightest faint of sweet taste that lasted only a second and was likely the dye of the paper or perhaps something else. the only discomfort I had was some mild stomach pains throughout the first few hours of the trip that went away with a banana (a very yummy banana) and some cannabis. I craved fruitÂ  A LOT during the first couple hours of the peak.There was only about 5-10 minutes or so of some come-up anxiety that I tend to get right before the energy releases in the start of the peak but the anxiety was mild transient and manageable.The trip took off right around +01:30 - 02:00.As it really took hold I found myself rolling around limbs abound with energy. I began to have saturated trails where I felt as though I was moving about in water. This was where the anxiety started and also ended as I became comfortable with the mystical sense of being that I was feeling. I compare the feeling to the way I feel when I try to move after smoking a decent amount of DMT. It feels like I'm made of water in a cosmic sort of way. Like that feeling when you sleep on your arm and you wake up and it's just this deadweight limb that you flail about for a minute or two except my whole body is swaying about in this way. the waves are just flowing through me like seaweed sway in the ocean. I always find remarkable this particular sense of being that DMT psilocybin and LSD provide. All different chemicals but the feeling is similar I think it may be what I've heard described as cosmic consciousness. This tab produced an incredibly pronounced state of this unique from any other L I've tried. i felt many of my chakras vibrating. There is quite a mushroomy feeling too to this LSD which is just fantastic.That's what I mostly would like to say about this print. There is so much elseÂ  and too many giggle fits to count (I can't explain how difficult and hilarious it was to load up my vaporizer for some cannabis) that it would take pages to describe.It's now +09:00 as i finish writing this and I feel truly blessed to have been able to experience this print. I can feel such positive energy from this crystal and the hands that made it prepared it and sent it.

Lol!  Must wear gloves sanitary environment-- or at the very least STEADY hands Along with my original order SunWu also sent a strip of their own laid blotters.  They are laid accurately (tested with u/v light for concentration).  Blotter proportions are perfect.  Not having to eat 1/2""^2 hits always makes me happy   They are 1/4""^2!!Gave some to a friend because I had developed a tolerance.  She shared them with others and they all reportedly had a great night with a single blotter each.  She estimates that they are at least ~150ug.I highly recommend SunWu-Int for LSD purchases.  The 10mg listing is MORE than just a great deal it's a great experience.  Plus 100 doses for 4$ a piece.. can't beat that!Will be back when the time is right.  Thanks so much.","psychedelics","370",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"362",NA,"pax's psychedelic review thread","  I received 3 hits of Colorado's LSD and it arrived in 3 days domestic to my location it came in a regular envelope with a zip-lock bag and 3 hits inside and fit in with regular mail.  Shipping/Packaging 5/5 : It arrived in 3 days which is pretty good for a domestic order within the US It did not look out of the ordinary from my regular mail which is great as well .. the only thing I could recommend for next time is that the vendor use a vacuum seal to send the LSD although this was just a short trip LSD is a very fragile molecule and degrades rapidly and a vacuum seal could help prevent so of that Other then that it arrived just fine and intact.Communication 5/5 : Communication was great he made sure that we both understood what was expected from each of us in this transaction and what we were both going to receive out of this deal as well as he was very knowledgeable about his product and what he would recommend as a dosage.Product 5/5 : the Product was just as described 3 hits of LSD on white blotter paper I took out all 3 of them and ate them. I did not notice any taste and the LSD felt very clean  while I hung out with a few of my close friends(they were doing cocaine) I noticed my friends had a lot of energy radiation off of them like I could physically see this energy as it was being emitted by them we  sat there and talked about every thing that came to our minds from the universe and determinism to philosophy and if free will exists and a broad range of many other topics of what we are going to do this summer and all our plans. We decided to go for a walk out side and I looked up at the stars and the moon it had not occurred to me before this point but I realized how beautiful the stars and universe is and then I realized that it is all alive and in motion.Overall 5/5 :  The Communication was wonderful The delivery time and packaging were right on par with most vendors and the LSD was clean and great so Overall what these tabs provided me with  was a nice clean LSD with some good friends and another great experience to remember with the lysergic molecule... thanks Colorado","psychedelics","412",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Truth is that we will not be returning this is our official retirement.The reason to give a return date was that we were worried people might think we were doing some kind of exit scam but everyone can now see from the past 3 weeks since we said that we have been as good as ever. And that will continue until all orders are closed and we have left.I hope these final 10 days will give you all enough time. It has been a pleasure serving you all.

I took 3 of them no im a psychonaut and i can handle my shit. but i was tripping so fucking hard mainly cause i think my moronic friend also on 831ug (3hits) started hitting me and saying god is the netity. during this i was having and Out of body experiance i didnt not what was really going on. he tells me out friend jake died from the lsd we had taken. so im tripping so hard hes got me thinking we are all dying tonight. anyways i thought Jesus was real and that we were dying and going to hell for an eternity of torture. It turns out that during my panic of thinking i was dying i was screaming and got naked trying to go take a shower. during that the neighbors called the cops because this was at like 3-4am and the cops ended up getting in our apartment when my GF went out for a cigarette. they ended up holding me down and arrresting me for the marjiuana in my house but i was so fucked they had to call paramedics to drug me up and take me away in an ambulance. my friend also they let my gf and other friend stay at my place didnt arrest them. they took some of the best molly ive ever ordered off SR too bad the vendor isnt aroundÂ  anymore this shit smelled like Anise/rootbeer so strong i never got to try it. they also didnt take any of my bong or oil rigs left like a qtr oz of shatter i had sitting in my pan from a finished purge. naywas i got away with more than that im so fucking lucky.

I've just recently started working with Hiniguel on sourcing products and am thrilled with how it's gone so far.     It would be nice to see people acting more professionally instead of just trying to organize a witch hunt.","psychedelics","264",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"379",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","These Tabs are very strong do not underestimate them like I did. A couple days ago I decided to drop 5 of Tess's tabs(1000ug) with not much experience and no tollerence. I was in for the trip of my life thats for sure. I consider myself a very experienced drug user (have k holed many times have done shroooms dxm E etc all many times) and when I use drugs I usually like to go hard and take very high doses as that gives the most intense experiences. But I have only done Lsd 2 times before this a couple weeks ago.Â My first experience was with 2 of Tess's tabs and I had the most amazing time ever. I tripped at home alone. The visuals were amazing and beautifull and the euphoria was amazing too and I was having all these amazing revelations about the world and myself. I loved it and couldn't wait to do more so 2 days later I decided to take 3. This time I wasn't as high as the first time due to tollerence but i still enjoyed it. Some visuals but not as much and some euphoria but not as much and I didn't have those revelations that I was having the first time.Â Fast foreward a couple weeks later and I decided to trip again. Since I handled 2 tabs pretty well I decided I wanted to do more for a better more intense experience. I was going back and forth between taking 3 or 4 but eventually I just thought fuck it I only have 5 left might as well take all of them and have a really intense experience. This time the setting was a little different. I was still alone but I was staying at a hotel.I took the 5 tabs at around 5pm. I started surfing the web a little while waiting for them to kick in. This time they kicked in much faster and I started feeling the effects within 20 to 30 minutes. I put on some music and laid back as I felt them starting to kick in. I was a little nervous at this point because of the dose I had taken but i wasn't freaking out or anything yet. Things started as normal and i started getting some nice visuals (patterns and colours on the ceiling and wall) and euphoria. But it kept getting stronger and stronger and at this point i was starting to get a little scared and my heart started beating very fast and very hard from the anxiety I was having because I took a large dose and didn't know what to expect. About 40 minutes in the effects were getting very strong and they were still coming stronger and stronger and I was thinking fuck I over did it I shouldn't have taken this much. I started to think I was dying because of my heart pounding so hard and so fast but I kept telling myself its ok no one has ever died from taking lsd and people have done much higher doses. It would calm me down for a second or two but then i would start thinking the same things again and my thoughts kept looping at a very quick speed. After a while of thinking I was dying and being scared out of my mind I decided to just let go and let it happen and once I let go the fear of me dying stopped.About 45 minutes to an hour in I was very very high. I think my heart calmed down a little at this point or I just forgot about it but it wasn't bothering me anymore. At this point I was scared because the effects were very very strong and they just kept getting stronger and stronger. Everything was a visual at this point and it was getting overwhelming. The visuals which i found beatufull last time were now getting way to overwhelming and were starting to scare me. Everything I looked at was warping and turning different colours and patterns were spinning all over the place. I could see every particle that made up objects and my vision would zoom in to objects and i could see the particles that the universe is made of up close. The room would expand to look like I was in this great big hall and then it would shrink to a small room. These are just some of the visuals that I can remember. I tried to stop fighting it and just give in and let the effects take over. When I stopped fighting it and gave in I couldnt see the room I was in anymore. Everything was blending and melting together. My thoughts were going at a million miles a second and every second seemed like an eternity. Time stopped having any meaning to me and whenever I would snap out of it for a second and look at the clock what seemed like an eternity to me was only a minute or so. I was having out of body experiences and i was reliving other people's lives in my mind people who I didn't know. After this I lost my ego and there was no more me. I stopped being myself and i was just melting away into the universe. There was no me there was no objects or rooms or ceiling or walls. Everything was melting together into the universe and everthing was just one. I don't know if that makes any sense but it's very hard to explain. This went on for what seemed like an eternity.After a while my ego came back to me at some point and at this time I thought I was going insane and was going to stay like this forever. The visuals were not stopping and were as intense as ever and I would think fuck I'm going to be stuck like this forever. I just wanted it to end at this point but knew I had at least 8 or so hours left as only a couple hours had passed by. Time seemed like it was standing still then going backward then forewards and its like time was just looping over and over again. Its like i had gone into another dimension and could see time going backwards and looping. It felt like time didn't affect me and I was just an observer in another dimension. Whenever I would start freaking out I would mumble the words its ok and that seemed to calm me down just enough to not run out of my room screaming that I had gone insane. I just wanted it to stop and I was seriously contemplating calling the police or something but then i would just mumble its ok and it seemed to help a bit. Also whenever I would start freaking out I would tell myself that people have done thumbprints and survived so I will be ok.Â  The most intense part of the peak lasted for about 4 or 5 hours I think. There was points during the peak where I would snap out of it for a second and calm down but then it would start again.After the peak had finished I was able to calm down a bit because i started coming down a tiny bit so I knew that this would end eventually. I was still very high after that for another at least 5 hours. The visuals were still very strong. Not as strong as during the peak but still incredibly strong. Walking was very difficult the whole time and pretty much impossible during the peak. At one point after the peak i decided I wanted to go outside so I stumbled out the door but the hallway was way too much for me and too confusing so I immediately went back into my room. I starting coming back to normal at about 5am I think so 12 hours later and I even managed to fall asleep at around 8am for a couple hours.All in all this was a very intense trip that had some very scary parts but had some very good parts too. Thinking I was dying was obviously very scary but when i just accepted it and gave in its like I stopped being scared of death and I feel like this will stick with me even after the trip. The part where I lost my ego was amazing and the most intense experinece of my life. If you do not have a lot of experience with LSD don't make the same mistake that I made and understimate the power of it because it is a very powerfull drug. I thought that I could handle doing 1000ug because I did 400ug and felt very good and then did 600ug with a tollerence and it didn't really get me too high but this was a big mistake. Tollerence has a huge effect and doing 600ug with a tollerence made me think that 1000ug without a tollerence wouldn't be too strong but boy was I wrong. The intensity of doing 1000ug with no tollerence was way stronger than I could ever imagine. I think the ony thing that kept me from totally freaking out and calling the cops or doing something stupid was the fact that I had a lot of experience with heavy trips(although not lsd) and also the fact that I read a lot of high dose trip reports all over the internet.","psychedelics","1586",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"380",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","This is my review for the Silk Road 277ug print. TLDR: Quick shipping some of my favorite xtal so far. Give it a try.Shipping 5/5: I've said it before and so has practically everyone who has left a review but just in case this is the first review of BlueViking you're reading his shipping is the some of the fastest on here. Now it may just be where I live but from all the reviews I read doesn't seem like that. Stealth 5/5: Not much to say here can't imagine one of these getting busted.Quality 5/5: I'm gonna talk about this more in the summarized trip report since this is what everyone cares about but to say it bluntly it's a really really good xtal. If you hang out around the LSD Discussion page you might see me or a few other people talking about dolphins an old print that some of my favorite vendors used to sell but isn't sold anymore (BV actually sold em a while ago). Anyway they were some DAMN fine LSD-25 and this is the closest experience I've ever had to those. Euphoric and clean is how I would describe it. I'd be amazed if someone had a bad trip on this. PS: I don't know if anyone else cares but me but the print fits onto small tabs which I really appreciate. I prefer each tab having a cool design over a sheet having a cool one so yeah just a personal preference.So here's my trip report if anyone's curious. I took 1 tab Friday night (I'm a lightweight when it comes to LSD and 277ug is strong enough for me) and my friend F took one and his girlfriend X took a Mayan (another clean xtal). We went to a house party and this was the first time I've ever been to a house party while tripping. Don't get me wrong I've been to quite a few concerts and a coupla raves while tripping and candyflipping but a house party always just seemed odd. And it was odd. As I was standing there talking to F we started discussing the current situation in Ukraine. But it mainly devolved into a conversation about how the world is just kind of going to shit but instead of a revolution in America we are just going to let it happen. X came over and her face looked gross for some reason. I just didn't like the way she looked at all and she was on a different page than us and I felt like I couldn't talk to her at all even though LSD usually makes me more social. So I left them alone and tried to make some new friends. Turns out high schoolers in my town are kinda closed minded. I went into the living room where there were only a few people smoking and had a few puffs. The living room had this really cool rug with this intricate Persian design that was vibrating with the music. Eventually we decided to get one of X's friends to give a ride back to F's place. It's a very chill apartment he's into Hinduism and Buddhism and has the walls decorated with big carpets. He lit some incense and I started feeling a bit like a third wheel","I went home an hour later. I was still tripping of course so I watched a LOT of Planet Earth not sure how long for but it was insanely beautiful. I felt so glad to be a part of this planet. I fell asleep quicker than normal had quite a bit to drink at the party.","psychedelics",609,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The biggest reason behind that lately is because other markets offer escrow protection for the buyer.

I've lost a lot of money... I hope I get it back soon but I've had to significantly increase my prices there today because I'm getting taxed a whopping 24% to vend there instead of 6%.

It's one of the main reasons I do this. Reading your review not only put my mind at ease it made me extremely happy to know that everything went well for you.

We will however be offering expedited shipping the week of Bicycle Day (and most likely be having a sale or two   )Hopefully everyone plans ahead of time but I know there are some people out there that like to procrastinate. Ohhhhhhh and I almost forgot. We have plans to lay 100ug prints of the new house crystal (with the new Viking artwork. We've had a lot of requests for 100ug prints) and we also have plans to put it in liquid form. If that happens it just might be the best liquid around.

"387",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Greetings shipmates.  Just wanted to drop in and leave a review for Tessellated's tabs.  Overall I couldn't have asked for a better transaction.  Tess has a spotless reputation for a reason.  My order arrived 12 days after it was marked as shipped and stealth was amazing (I'm still trying to figure out how they pull that trick off).  I decided to try two tabs that evening.  It had been several months since my last trip.  A little back-story I had tried ""acid"" two times previously.  The first time the tab was so weak that it was barely a threshold dose and the second time it was almost certainly some variety of NBOME (as indicated by the intense bitterness and numbing of my mouth as well as profuse vomiting about 20 minutes after dosing).  I also have experience with other psychedelics such as mushrooms mescaline and salvia divinorum; but I consider this to be my first ""real"" LSD experience.  I placed the two tabs under my tongue and waited.  After about 20 minutes I could feel an electric energy flowing through my body a feeling that intensified as time passed.  I attempted to keep a trip log on my laptop but after about 45 minutes it became apparent that I would not be able to type for much longer.  I was listening to some good psychedelic trance music and at about the one hour mark I felt myself totally melting into the experience.  I sunk back into my chair closed my eyes and fell into an immersive psychedelic state.  I couldn't really move and saw no need to; time as I knew it ceased to exist.  This is the closest I have ever come to ""ego death.""  My mind sailed through this space just going with the music for what felt like ages but for what I estimate to be about an hour.  I then came back to my senses a bit and became aware of the crazy visuals that I was experiencing.  The visuals were quite different from those I have experienced on other psychedelics.  When I would look at something it was as if my visual perspective would shift slightly every half second or so; casting a different type of shadow and depth upon the object.  Patterned surfaces were tiling shifting and tessellating (lol) upon each other.  Tracers following moving objects were very apparent.  Looking at a stone-tiled floor was absolutely mind blowing.  After another hour or so of listening to music I had regained enough touch with reality to get up and explore.  I had a great time exploring my house giggling like a fool at the smallest of things.  Things like taking a shower and staring at myself in a mirror were immensely interesting.  The trip began to come to a end as I watched the sunrise outside.  Overall this was a great experience and one of the strongest trips I have ever had.  Overall duration of the trip was about 10 hours after which I was able to easily fall asleep.  As for potency these tabs are no joke.  For someone inexperienced with psychedelics I would not recommend more than one tab. For me two tabs was not too much to handle but damn was it intense.  I look forward to tripping again soon although I may reduce the dose to one or one-and-one-half tabs.    A huge thank you to Tessellated for being so professional and providing a fantastic product.  Vendors like yourself make this community great and keep us free in an un-free world.  I look forward to doing business with you again soon.  God bless you Tess.","psychedelics","604",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"388",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Report: House Brand High White XtalDose: 2 x 150 ug tabsWould I buy again: YesThis was my third and most enjoyable LSD trip to date (all within the past month).I was aiming for a fun and sociable day-trip this time around. I'm pleased to say the results far exceeded that goal.This will go down as one of the best days of my life. Fun: check. Social: check. Unexpected life-changing event: check.At about 6 hrs in an important person in my life dropped by unexpectedly needing to discuss an important dilemma. Tears and all. I listened and we talked. The dilemma was resolved in the way best imaginable. It was perfect and it was beautiful. And it may have been independent of LSD (hard to say) but it was the pinnacle of my trip. One of the most perfect days of my life.As far as the trip itself was concerned it couldn't have been better. Visually spectacular OEV+CEVs immense euphoria. Great headspace. No mindfuck. Zero uncomfortable bodyload or restlessness. Sleep came naturally and unexpectedly when I layed down many hours later. I awoke refreshed and energized in the morning and my first thought/reflection on the trip was how clean and smooth it was especially the transition to sleep. The overall experience from beginning to end reminded me of a candle burning into the night steadily glowing away until it burns out smoothly and without notice (hope that makes sense). Clean trip! Also tabs were tasteless no problems with bitter ink.I'm completely satisfied with these House Brand tabs. Everyone I've shared them with has told me they've never had better acid. I'm curious to try some other types of crystal available (Mayans especially) but actually doing so will be a difficult choice in the future (unless I go with both).----------------------------------------------Report:2C-B HClDose: 14+14...+14 (42 mg total but 28 mg was plenty perfect for my tastes)Would I buy again: YesI have to say I'm very satisfied with this new batch of 2C-B HCl. I tested it out yesterday as I mentioned in my post last night. I prefer insufflating 2C-B over oral dosing and started off by starting 14 mg. I've read somewhere that the HCl salt tends to burn more than HBr. I found that not to be the case. To me it seemed slightly more tolerable.Once the initial 14 mg kicked in and all was very good I snorted an additional 14 mg. This (28 mg) tends to be my sweet-spot with 2C-B and that spot has never been sweeter than last evening. Vividly colorful and active OEV + CEV. Euphoria was strong and I was in a beautiful place. As previously mentioned it felt very sexy and erotic to me on top of the usually fun and good times I have on 2C-B. I snorted another 14 mg which was totally unnecessary putting me at 42 mg total by the 2 hr mark. The bodyload was surprisingly minimal. In fact I don't recall any uncomfortable body load. Just positive energy. I say surprising because a) 2C-B HCl is more potent than HBr and b) bodyloads in the past (while tolerable) have annoyed me enough to restrict use more than I'd care too.Past 2C-B experiences have usually ended with insomnia and an uncomfortable itchy sensations. This time I was relieved by absence of any of this and sleep came naturally. I awoke rested feeling positive clear-headed and it's been a great day.I need to use the HCl a couple more times and compare it to the HBr (I lost a small quantity but found it to my delight this week)... but right now I'm huge fan of this new batch. Given the choice between the two I'd go with the HCl. Could just be me though.Big thanks to BlueViking for this awesome contest (I know we all had serious fun with this) being an amazing vendor and all around kindness. I appreciate the extra weight included not only in my 2C-B order but my 2C-B sample price as well. :","psychedelics","668",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"390",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Hey everyone! I'd like to share with you my trip report (FIRST EVER!)Â  Let me first preface this by saying that this vendor takes his stealth very seriously. The delivery time also was about four business days (2 thumps up)Let me start by saying that my goal was to gain a higher awareness of my inner self in a very spiritual way. I decided to pick a setting that was comforting and would be free of distraction. For me that was my own roomÂ  Cuddled in my bed I prepared a playlist of Mysterious Mountain by Hovhaness Faure's Requium Deep Forest World Mix and also some Gregorian chants. My trip started within the first 20 minutes because I took the vendor's advice for a faster trip. I mixed the psilocybin with lemon juice so that the acid breaks it down a bit before ingested.After the first 30 minutes my arms started splaying out naturally in euphoria. I saw glimmers of light and instead of moving on I decided to explore that a little more. I entered inside the light source and it opened up another world. As more time went on I felt a gradual loss of ego and the removal of the walls of my inner mind. The trip did however take a turn at one point and I did feel that I was within this reservoir of darkness (almost like an underground sewer). Oddly I wanted to explore that more but for some reason that phase ended quickly. After the first hour my mind was seeing little tiny particles (almost like the lattice structures of a crystal). I also saw wavy strings of energy and a vortex of other kinds of particles. My eyes were closed for the vast majority of my trip and that's a good thing! Ironically when your eyes are closed you actually 'see' the clearest. I would say that the music was a very effective conduit for my mind's creative flow. For a lot of the time I wasn't even aware that it was playing but when the song would transition I would know! Therefore my mind was using this conduit whether I was aware of it or not. About midway through my trip turned more philosophical. I felt like I was confronted with the most fundamental of human questions. Our domain is the universe and here we are for a small sliver of time. I felt like life could be so much more if we could channel our energies in the right way. I felt awed by the power and creativity of the mind. I can't go back now and feel or remember the way it felt to be me during this stage. I'm a little sad because so many exact details are now lost forever. Yet I do know that it brought me to my knees just thinking about the power and creative beauty of the mind. After about two and a half hours I felt my trip wearing off slowly. I decided to get out of my dark room and take a look outside. I live in the city (not exactly the best neighborhood either). When I opened the front door I was amazed to see that the streets glistened with the purest whitest glow. It was heaven-like. Feeling completely cleansed from within I remember thinking at that moment that this is the way life was meant to be The trip did last me only about 3 hours. I wished it was more but I was very grateful for the precious time that I did have deep within the bowels of my innermost mind. But here's the good news: It feels a lot longer during your trip! I was shocked to wake out of it and find that only 3 hours had passed. Back to my normal consciousness I went shopping to get some bread OJ and fruit. I felt so at one with everything. I breathed a sigh of peace and joy. It felt so good to be me. THANKS TRIP!!","psychedelics","671",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"392",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Purchased for the first time. Arrived last Thursday in the USA 6 days after shipment. I'd never done LSD before so I tried 1 tab this past Friday. I chewed for 30 mnutes and then about 30 minutes later I was all over the place. I had a microphone going to record everything I said for the first 4 or 5 hours. I really felt the sublties in life.. everything felt very clean and proper.. hard to completely explain. It was like a lightswitch a snap of my fingers and I was in a new world one that felt like everything was perfect. That lasted for about 6 hours and then I started to mellow out into a pot-like high. Overall the effects lasted about 12 hours with the intense tripping lasting about 4-5. Really amazing experience. I'd give it a 5 out of 5.I am completely satisfied with Tessellated's service and product. Thanks again. I will be buying again!","psychedelics","160",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thanks!I was very pleased with the trip I experienced.  Love the House blotters and 2 send me where I need to go.  It was very visual for me.  Staring at the bathroom wall... A fractal was swirling around the middle.  It opened up with beams of golden light as birds flew away from it.  That is just one of the visions I experienced.A couple hours into the trip I added some 2c-b.  Not sure if I consumed enough but kept smiling throughout the trip anyways.  The 2c-b seems really interesting to me and I want to take a bigger dose to truly feel the nature of this chemical. Thinking about writing a trip report.  I've always enjoyed reading other's experiences and would like people to take delight in mine as well.The blotters for the 5xHouse Blotters did get mixed up with the Swiss Hoffmanns but BlueViking offered to make it up on my next order.

I did 1 vial alone in my room and after 10 minutes my stomach began to feel slightly uncomfortabe but it surely wasn't that bad at all some initial discomfort was expected. At the 30 minute mark pictures began to slowly move as if they were gifs. I felt incredibly happy i laughed a lot louder than i usually would've while browsing tumblr simply because things just looked so amazing and funny.. At the 50 minute mark colors and pictures seem so much more vivid. I felt as though i were actually there in the pictures. At the 1 hour mark is where it gets absolutely amazing. I felt connected to everyone I loved and accepted everyone for who they were. I understood everything and nothing at the same time. I could go on and on about the things I saw but I'd have to write a whole book. I'd say the whole trip lasted about 2 and half hours or so.

After some hesitation around 10:00 AM I go out with my bag in which there is my stuffs for the day: clothes food water headphone with portable music player etc. and 1 Dala誰 Lama tab. I wait for the bus slightly worried because I do not feel good. Well I'll see at the trip spot (a forest) if I want to drop the tab or not. If not it'll still be a nice walk outside.At the forest. I walk around until I'm somewhere almost secluded. Okay let's do this I think I don't feel great and probably won't but it'll still be an interesting day. I put the tab on my tongue. There is no taste I swallow it.45 min to 1 hour later I'm coming up. It's not easy on my body and I'm glad it's LSD because I don't know an easier psychedelic on the body. I'm kind of sick anyway so I can't escape the bodyload.When the peak started I felt way better. I won't say too much about the trip you know obviously an LSD trip in the forest can bring some primal feels. Also the dose was strong enough to make me all emotionnal crying at some point but at the same time I was very clear-headed detached from this suffering. Emotions flowing freely without attachment. I felt compassion for myself and all beings pondered about human society and so on. Nothing unusual for an LSD trip. It wasn't very recreational visuals were ok but nothing impressive and I had less audio hallucinations than usual (in some previous trips I could hear voices and so: maybe I'm no longer a paranoid dude).It was sunday so there was a few people walking around with family and their dogs so I'm glad I wasn't tripping harder.All in all it was exhausting. People don't trip when you are tired or sick: it feels less good and IMO can dull the headspace to some extent.Obviously this is a good strong blotter of LSD. Take only 1 if you choose to trip in a semi-public setting like this or take 2 in a private place (with a sitter preferably) if you want to be disintegrated.About the service:The packaging was good nothing suspicious and vendor communication is excellent.

I ordered from Lynx Industries some time ago but due to a combination of events never got the chance to review this great vendor.Communication 10/10Only had to send a few messages but all were answer curtly.Shipping/Packaging 9/10The shipping time to Europe took about 5/6 days but this is really due to excellent and professional service Lynx Industries offers because they shipped my order as soon as it came through before I could FE. This was just before the hack so I hope they did get my bitcoins. The packaging and stealth could have been better however I know this would be more costly and so maybe the trade off isnât worth it.Product 10/10The mushrooms were bang on weight wise and they were as ground up as I thought they would be. I took them to a party with me to share around with some friends. We had all taken a fair amount of mdma (.25g I think) and the mushrooms added an enhanced visual experience with colours being much more vibrant. I was also under the impression that there was some added euphoria to the mdma because of the mushrooms.Unfortunately I was not in any state to determine the quantity we each took exactly but Iâd say I took about a gram.Overall it was a really good trip and I will be back for more in the future.","psychedelics","238",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Flaweless.  His shipping speeds literally beat any vendor I've never waited more than 4 days ever.  His communication is quick friendly and professional.  His packaging/stealth is simply superior to any other vendor I have encountered.Most recently I ordered 2g MDMA on Friday... it arrived Tuesday.  Batch had a crushed crystalline texture and was whiter than last time but still had that unmistakable smell of fucking bomb safrole MDMA so it was clearly washed really well which im personally not picky about but great either way.  Anyways I wasnt planning on eating it last night but of course I couldnt resist after admiring it all day.Ended up eating 170mg with my girlfriend who ate about 160mg which is alot with this product you only really need 100mg of this to get a solid roll.  We also gave a fortunate friend 150mg just because we're nice like that.  Took about half an hour to get that comfortable familiar feeling in my belly that a nice clean roll is approaching.  By an hour into it we were totally faced riding a perfect plateu for a solid 4 hours.  No speedy feeling no feeling like you need to take more just enhanced senses empathy laughter and love the whole time.  Went to a concert music and lights were incredible chatting with friends and strangers both were also great fun.Woke up this morning feeling really really good... almost felt so good like I was still mildly rolling but that quickly faded into a very pleasant afterglow feeling reflecting on how great last night was.Anyways I just want spread some kind and true words to Instrument and to be aware that I have used more popular MDMA vendors than Instrument on SR and other markets and have NEVER had the consistent service and quality product that Instrument provides at a more than fair price.  Just give him a try you won't regret it.","psychedelics","345",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This here now is my slice of life to enjoy because I've earned every bit of it :-)8:01 - Down the hatch!8:13 - First alerts in my tummy big ol grin on my face :-)8:33 - Phoowee! Can feel that comin on quickly but in a good way. Ever-so-slightly anxious. Gotta shit...even though my stomach had to have been empty. Not sure how that works. Maybe it's just a feeling. [It was]I can feel/see slight changes in my vision although it's really hard to say exactly what's different about it. If nothing else my vision is very clear and if I scan the room I can just ... feel something. It's hard to put my finger on it. Boy the second this relaxing music came on (Pandora - Calm meditation) I could feel pressure taken off my chest and I could breath more easily and it's helping me to focus on simply relaxing and enjoying the ride instead of worrying about what to do next..Calmness - slow and steady wins the race :-)8:40 (even though i've been typing since that last entry this feels like something worth a new entry) Motor function seems a bit ... slow like being drunk only more ... somethingI burpred which felt pretty good. I feel like I got over a hump there.I was just stretching and I glanced in the corner at my fake tree (it's funny how I never notice it even if I move it) and there is undeniably color depth and enhanced clarity that wasn't there before. Something about the intricate patterns and the specific colors really set it off.I am feeling very... wobbling almost holding something down [in my stomach] momentarily.I feel like I need to focus in order to breath normally without tension in my chest. I mean...I'm doing well keeping thing in control and the music definitely helps.Another burp not a small one either. Kinda odd/funny that it's been 45 minutes since ingesting any sort of thing and it's been....I dunno 6 hours and 45 minutes since I last ate that reuben ""pinini"" soup and drink.8:46 new entry (haha)Um definitely noticing if I scan the text in this document I was seeing... there it goes. I would call it line distortions.Whoa and I'm definitely feeling more ...spacey so to speak and it feels realy great to stretch. Not sure if this is having an affect on my muscles or if it's just a coincidink.8:49 Whoa - I seem to be getting a whoa feeling every once in a while.I'm definitely seeing um i guess...bubbles of magnification. They don't look like bubbles but it's like part of the center of my vision comes up in a cone so to speak. It's kinda hard to replicate with my eyes. It just sorta happens randomly/in waves. lovely lovely little waves (haha).This music is good but I'd like to try something.....still relaxing I guess but not as....I dunno just something different but similar.My 'Across The Unverse' channel seems fitting by name anyway. Blink182 came on first and it just wasn't cuttin. Hey There Delilah works I guess.Transferring to the toilet now. Not sure if I need to drop a deuce or not but I'm definitely taking my phone and the music with me.Oh I should add that the cords were kinda getitng in my way it took very deliberate motions to finally just pick up the phone and move it aside.8:56 The music just cut out and it reminds me to say that below the music I seem to be very ... tappy and I don't want to say ""jittery"" per se just I dunno restless and sorta caffeine-y.9:00 Almost exactly an hour after ingestion and it's definitely kicking into gear.Fucking internet issues interfering with ... with the music.I fading out here and I feel thr urge to just close my eyes and enjoy itYawning is defnitely part of it.910This crap with the intermittent internet connection keeps interferring with my groove and it's hard to get lost in thought when there are abrupt random silences in the musics.It's really puzzling.915 Here. Here is where it's at. Right here. Love this moment right here.super tired-y. Very interal space. I love it but i' noture if this is a dual-perons experience or not. Nothing wring if it is but it's sooo internal that I I don't know if I could focus on P or the experiece as a group925 Puased he music and I'm feelimg very zen.1250 Wow! So much has happened in the last three hours that it's almost a shame I can't capture those moments and feelngs of comfort. I mean I can record what I was feeling but to actually FEEL them is something all to itself.In particular not long after the come-up I had this longs stretch of VERY warm comfortable moments of just absolute zen comfortable beyond all measure. Wow! I mean those are the moments that life is made of! And I can see why Trip does what he does. The idea of being able to broadcast those feelings across the universe is an amazing thought. The world could use more this stuff. Not necessarily the substance itself but the moments that were a direct result of the substance.------By the way I was feeling more mild after-affects well after 12:50 but I felt like my feet were back down on Earth so to speak.I should also add that for some reason I chose pickle juice as a chaser (won't be doing THAT again) and the combination of taste left in my mouth weren't exactly pleasant. I quickly followed that up with a Hershey's kiss though which did really well at blocking any other taste and was quite pleasant.Also I do remember a very slight burning sensation in the back of my throat kinda like after doing a shot of really potent alcohol and the liquid itself did actually kinda smell like rubbing alcohol. I mean...more faint that whiffing a bottle of it but in comparison to the rewards I received on this adventure it's barely even a consideration in my mind and I would (will) do it all over again in a heartbeat. In fact...I just might have another little romp tonight.Anyway!

"403",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Tab estimated at around ~220ug (Extra strength from last year) and during the come up I watched Bob Ross. When the paints started moving around on me I put on some Mozart laid down and blasted off. Let me say that listening to his work was absolutely divine wow. I've tried out a few different artists and styles of music in the past but his felt like an absolute masterpiece with how precise and...mathematical(?) it sounded. Closing my eyes everything would be black except small green lines/vines that would travel across my vision in loops and wavy lines to the tune of the music until during a high point in the song white flowers would bloom off the sides of it and split off into other vines that would wait until the music hit another high point before they did the same. I would come out of it every 5-10 minutes and sit up to have a bit of water before going back in for another round. There were other neat closed eye effects like going down a spiral path into seeming infinity and things like that but the vines were most interesting. With open eyes I laid on my stomach on the floor and put my face in my sleeve (wearing black long sleeve shirt) so I could see a bit of the carpet and my sleeve with some light shining through the opening in the crook of my arm and then the carpet began to glow and I felt like I was floating in earth's orbit with the white carpet representing the atmosphere and the black on my sleeve feeling like open space. When I covered my eyes more with the sleeve there was a speck of dust on it and then it felt like I was out in space and was looking at the dust from far away which felt like I was looking at the earth or moon for a few seconds.When I was coming near the end of the peak I had my eyes closed and was going down into a spiral pattern then suddenly it felt like I was falling *up* a flight of stairs and was thrown out of the spiral before I opened my eyes and got my senses back as the song I was listening to ended and shortly after (~15 minutes) the peak was noticeably over. It was by far the absolute strangest(not in a bad way) thing I've ever felt.Thanks for another great trip Tess!","psychedelics","416",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"410",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","I'm not gonna do a full review here just because I want to really get down to the meat and potatoes. I took both of the doses with no tolerance going in. The HBr was my first time ever and the HCl was my third time. In both of my previous reviews I've stated that the shipping is fast and the stealth is excellent. Starting to feel like a broken record now. In comparison to the HCl the HBr felt less potent. I know that it IS less potent but I actually took much more HBr than HCl. Took about 20 mgs HBr and 10 HCl. The HCl still felt stronger was getting a lot more OEV's and the personality shift was much more apparent as my girlfriend remarked. I've read that 2C-B was an erotic substance so I figured I wouldn't want to try it alone or with a guy. As far as erotic potential goes (the details of which are probably better suited for one of Kooch's threads) I'd say there's great potential.Back to the personality shift. When I take good clean LSD like the mayans for example I become a lot more social and open to jokes. I'm generally a pretty light-hearted person but I have social anxiety to a degree. LSD makes me realize how stupid that is emotionally. Intellectually I've always realized how stupid it is and how everyone is not always harshly judging me but emotionally knowing it is what really affects me. The 2C-B HCl and the HBr (somewhat) have both had that effect on me. It's one I really enjoy it lets me connect with my girlfriend a lot better. It's hard to really know someone until you've tripped with them. As for the CEV's mine weren't that intense with the HCl or the HBr. I'm not a huge CEV guy though don't normally get really intense ones. Overall A+. Just a heads up though didn't insufflate either the HBr or the HCl so I can't speak to the pain of either as for that ROA.","psychedelics","344",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"411",NA,"retirement announcement*~sunwu feedback thread~~ lsd specific review","I've bought LSD crystal from SunWu three times now. On my first purchase I was very nervous. I had no experience with SunWu. Readng his review thread helped placate my fears but when dealing with a $400 order that was done directly with the vendor via email it's hard to be completely confident. I have never dealt directly with a vendor before. I've previously finalized early for a few of my trusted LSD vendors but this was something else. The order took a little longer than I thought (I ordered on a Thursday it didn't ship out till Monday or Tuesday) and as a result I started to panic a little. SunWu reassured me that it had shipped out on Monday/Tuesday and that I would have it soon.I am now absolutely confident in SunWu. He is polite courteous very patient and professional. His prices for LSD crystal are very good. I've been spoiled I have no need for prelaid tabs now I'm only going to be buying crystal for the rest of my LSD-using years. One day I hope to have enough money that I can stock up buy a few grams and have enough for my lifetime usage.  Anyway I've digressed. Now onto the review...SunWu advertises his LSD as >98% pure. He mentioned on the other thread that he's upped it to 99% lately (so my current order should be 99%). He's provided me with analytical documents to show this but it's not necessary I was simply just curious. I can say with confidence that his LSD is some of the purest I have ever had the pleasure of obtaining. It dissolves completely clear into distilled water to make a solution of 2000 μg/mL. I haven't made up my mind what about LSD makes it feel unclean and I know some of the effects attributed (back pain etc.) are really just side effects of LSD itself but again I've digressed.I tend to do higher doses of LSD than perhaps the average. My first experience with SunWu's LSD was at ~500 μg. I knew I was going to be tripping very hard when within 20 minutes of ingesting it I began to see fractals everywhere. It hit me hard and fast. I've found that I'm always perfectly clear headed on this LSD. I get the psychedelic introspection and thought-process modifications but I'm perfectly lucid and my mind feels very sharp. I'm not going to give a full trip report because those are a dime a dozen for LSD. I experienced complete synaesthesia for the first time. I was listening to the Audien remix of Pompeii and was brought to tears. It was beautiful. I became part of the music. The entirety of the peak I was euphoric more than I've ever been in my life. Not only was I mentally euphoric my body felt amazing. I've never felt so good in my entire life. I'm not really sure how to describe the sensation. It wasn't pleasure in the sense that an orgasm is pleasurable but there's it was unmistakeably physical pleasure. The euphoria was more intense than I've ever felt from any opiates ever. I was so happy that I cried. I spent part of the trip with my fiancee giggling and laughing and having fun together. The feeling of love that I have for her completely engulfed me intensifying the euphoric infinitely. During the peak I experienced ""truer"" hallucinations. My vision was completely enveloped by fractals. Unlike the typical LSD pseudohallucinations (that emerge as patterns rippling objects ""breathing"" that kind of thing). these fractals didn't originate in anything real. During the highest part of the peak I couldn't actually see the real world. It lasted about 12h with some residual effects going on for a few hours after that. I dosed at about 1pm I fell asleep very easily as soon as I hit the pillow (around 3am). I easily could have went to sleep sooner I just didn't feel like doing so. I've never had problems sleeping after SunWu's LSD.If you have even the slightest inclination to try out SunWu's LSD do it. You won't regret it. He's one of the most professional vendors I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. And his LSD is some of the cleanest most pure that I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. SunWu: Please continue vending forever! I consider myself incredibly lucky to have found a source for crystal LSD and I would love to deal with you for many years to come.","psychedelics","753",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"413",NA,"retirement announcement*~sunwu feedback thread~~ lsd specific review","I would not normally post a message here but to me it's very hard to understand this seems like a good place I might get some opinion on this? And some might find it interesting  And now for an insight into the day of SunWu.. QuoteHey Sun I need to ask you a favor.  I believe we talked before but I don't think it was on SR.  I'm trying to get agood bit of LSD if I can but I really do not have much money.  I can probably round up enough to purchase 10mgbut I was aiming to get more than that.Long story short - I have tripped many times over the last two years and have gained a higher awareness fromthe Akashic records and began sharing the ancient knowledge/wisdom I learned with the world.I had a vision not physically of a music festival that could bring world peace through a mass meditive effort bya million people.  Mass meditation has been proven to have an effect on war violence and crime the energy ofsome truly does spread to those around them.Part of this vision is the moment of singularity.  The moment when love outweighs doubt and physics can bedefied.  I came to the belief that if I took a thumbprint of acid anywhere from 1000-10000 hits that I couldfloat.  With the crowd witnessing the event a rapid acceleration of human consciousness would occur wherepeople in the crowd begin floating too and all negative energy then vanishes and we enter a higher dimensionthat transcends physical laws.Since then I've met a friend that I used to play hockey against and he told me how he levitated the first time hetook shrooms.  He said that sober girls saw him he jumped off a dirt mound at a motorcross track and brieflylevitated for a moment.I have personally seen physics violated before when I was at the beach the first time I tripped with other people.A lamp in the middle of the room no one was around jumped off the table and multiple of us saw it happen.I haven't tripped for about four months until recently.  A little over a week ago I took some MXE and saw friendsthat I haven't seen in a good while.  While discussing various things with them I could see a shift in consciousnessin them inlcuding their dad who understood where I was coming from very well.  What then happened is that Ispontaneously decided to take the two hits of acid I've had in my cigarette box for a couple months because I feltI was on a positive feedback loop and it would be good to do at 4:00 in the morning mind you.I listened to Jimi Hendrix and my vibe got better and better I was gaining more self awareness than I ever havebefore.  I decided to lay down and attempt to experience full out egodeath like I had at the beach.  I becameexponentially aware of self awareness and large amounts of energy accumulated within me.  I let go of my bodycompletely and I could feel my hand starting to gravitate upwards with no muscle.  I could feel from the energya hand reaching down from the ceiling.  My friend had recently passed and I felt that it was him reaching down topull me up to heaven whatever you may call that dimension.  My hand rose by itself and stayed suspended for acouple minutes without any physical effort.  The other hand also rose for a brief period of time.The next morning I thought we were in heaven because I had confirmingly defied gravity consciously.A few days ago while I was waking up I experienced something similar a burst of energy rushed through me andI thought to myself am I about to levitate?  It was the same feeling I have felt in dreams where I have willedmyself to fly.  Sure enough the same hand rises about a foot above the bed before dropping momentarilyafter.But this time I was sober no drugs from the previous day or anything.  This further confirms my belief that weare able to defy physics and levitation under the influence of large amounts of LSD at a music festival is possible.Truly I would like to dwell into as much LSD as I can before the music festival to possibly become comfortableand practice that state of awareness.  I'm not asking for a gram of acid though I can tell you if you chose toshare that with me your actions would change the world significantly.  My methodology is LSD decreases the egoso the more acid I take the more loving of a person I become and the more positivity I emit to the world aroundme.  Psychedelics have given me the strength to lose fear to the point of standing up against the oppressiveregime of the world.  They truly bring peace and enlighten the world.I also began playing electric guitar.  Since I had my experience consciously defying gravity I have gotten much fasteraccurate and better.  I post my stuff online normally I receive no feedback or just negative feedback but this timeover a dozen people complemented my work.  One offered to pay me bitcoins to play at his wedding and onesent $150 of bitcoins as a tip.  I still have a ton of work to do and much room for improvement but seeing thatsort of support unexpectedly is a big motivator.  LSD helps me play very much so as I play freestyle just as I'msure it played a huge role in Jimi Hendrix's work.If you look at the world I truly do not feel the global economy namely the USDollar has long to flourish.  It's beendevalued 98% since 100 years ago and people are starting to catch on that inflationary fiat currencies are doomedto fail.  My recommendation to you is to put your money into physical assets whether it's food land LSD somethingyou can use is much better than something you can't.  The way I see it transferring it into a physical commoditydoes not remove the value of your money just transfers it into something useful.If you have more than you need and are able to spare some I am in the position to put whatever amount to gooduse and spread it through mediums of music and words on the internet and otherwise.  Our actions ripple throughoutthe universe and I want to give you a chance to help change the world for your benefit my benefit and everyone'sbenefit as well.  There's infinite peace to be felt.Sorry if I flooded you with information and sorry that it was not quite as short as I thought it would be but life is acrazy dream and as we awaken from our unconscious awareness it is going to become crazier.  Whether your worldis positive or negative is up to you your state of mind will determine your reality.  I can say though death is nothingto fear.  Infinite peace and possibilities await on the other side.  Hopefully we can consciously kill our ego's rather thanphysically.Please get back to me when you can I feel society is hanging on by threads and time is of essence.  I appreciate yourtime and feel free to write back if you have any questions or anything.Peace be with you","psychedelics","1200",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"414",NA,"retirement announcement*~sunwu feedback thread~~ lsd specific review","I study neuroscience and I hope my future research direction to focus on the neuroscience of LSD and its potential for being used in the improvement of the human condition. I have terrible anxiety of dying and LSD has helped me greatly. I agree that LSD can be used medically to great benefit and I wish the world we live in would be one where LSD was available for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately this isn't so. Prohibition has made precursors difficult to acquire and thus expensive. I don't know your cost to make LSD but I've done some calculations to get an estimate and I don't think your profit margin on the LSD is very high (especially in bulk orders). I think you do great work in synthesizing and making LSD available for relatively cheap but you don't run a charity. I'm using the LSD I acquire from you in scientific experiments but I don't expect you to provide it just out of the goodness of your heart. I believe he has good intentions but his methods just aren't realistic. You can easily make enough profit on selling 300 tabs at $6 each to be able to buy the next largest order (25 mg) at zero cost to yourself. Continue doing this even selling at $5/tab and if you spread the love enough you can reinvest all your profits into more LSD and come out even. If this guy is really serious and thinks that having a large supply of LSD for himself will help him change the world there is a way to do so sustainably by slowly collecting profit and reinvesting into more LSD. Yes it will take a while to be able to buy higher and higher bulk amounts and thus be able to completely fund his own supply. If he truly believes in it he will be okay turning his profit into his own stock of LSD.I think you could propose this idea to him. I'm sure you have the ability to make quite a stock of LSD and I'm sure you are making sufficient money but you should be fairly compensated for your hard labour.I really appreciate what you do and in an ideal world LSD would be so cheap that we could all afford to buy it in 100 g increments but that's just not realistic in the era of prohibition.","psychedelics","398",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"415",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","BV your SR prints are definitely a work of art!  I would like to share my most recent experience.Dropped at 4pm - 2 tabs.4pm to 5pm:  Very quick but smooth onset of about 20 minutes.  The first thing I remember thinking was why is everything covered in an orange and yellow hue?  Oh yeah well here we go!  Despite being on a higher dose there were no digestive problems or other physical discomfort.  The OEVs were very pronounced and active although not intrusive or distracting. The hard part during this first hour was keeping focused on what was in front of me. My mind was racing to many different ideas at the same time and I finally gave in to my mind's wishes and jumped into the stream. At that point an hour had passed and I was fully catapulted into an immersive psychedelic journey. 5pm to 9pm:  the peak lasted about 4 hours with constant waves of thought and energy flowing through me. At one point I was looking at my hands thinking how incredible of a creation they are. The setting sun and the shadows being cast played games with my thoughts as everything seemed alive and at times whirling around me as the focal point.  Putting on some tunes would have been perfect at this point but strangely enough I never thought about the music. I recall feeling like I was joined to my surroundings and just started walking. The feeling of my feet striking the ground and moving me while at the same time connected to the ground was feeling incredible. I could feel the warmth of my surrounding meeting the LSD and carrying me away.9pm to midnight:  the comedown was longer than from a lower dose. It was a time to review myself and groove on some introspection. At this time I was able to explore many areas and consider different facets of who I am. I have to say this being the first time on this type of dose it was a little of what I had expected but I do not believe anyone is fully ready for their first complete submersion.  Also there was never any hint of negative thought fear or anxiety to threaten the trip and change it to a negative experience. After the 8 or so hours I was left with a peace of mind and a feeling of being centered. This afterglow lasted for most of the next day. If you are contemplating taking more than one of the SR prints I would say that it would be well worth the experience.  Do make sure you are in a good environment and with good companions or you should wait until the setting is ideal. Be prepared to lose yourself and your ego entirely at more than one point in your trip and above all enjoy yourself.  BV has a huge winner with these!  I am looking forward to trying the house prints and 2CB as I read all of the glowing reports and feedback.

"417",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","So these reviews are a long time coming. I ordered late last year and had my first trip in January. Honestly it was not what I expected. It wasn't nearly as strong and as well trippy as I thought. I think I spent too much time over thinking things and treating it like an experiment. Like riding a roller coaster and trying to estimate how many Gs I'm pulling rather than just throwing your hands up and screaming. I messaged Tess directly about some questions and he was very responsive and helpful.My second trip last week was a different matter. I had a rare opportunity to to do another 200ug during a nice spring day. Unlike January I was able to really spend some time outside. That made all the difference. Being in such a nice setting and also doing some light hiking somehow let me channel all of that nervous energy into something new. Sunlight blooming flowers and budding trees were an awe enspiring sight. A few deer crossed my path later in the day about 6 hours in while I was coming down. I guess I understand what people mean when they talk about new feelings of empathy and telepathy. When the deer was looking at me and sizing me up I feel that I was somehow able to read it's body language and posturing. A few times during Feb and March I also microdosed ~15ug (with some percise cuts). Once also before a hike. It was like having a very strong cup of coffee right after having great sex. I was clearly in a better mood and somehow had an extra bit of engergy while climbing up hills. I took many photos on that trip some of which are on Panoramio/Google Earth. A few have had a hundred views already and even a few comments. If it wasn't posted on my public google account I would love to say ""Yes those were some really nice reflections on the water.

First time it was ever like ""MDMA + LSD but nothing like the two"" as I had it described to me the first time. I had a few moments of disconnection and confusion but I was in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar faces. Completely changed my opinion of 2cb though. Now it's one of my favorite substances. It was like the first time I tried MDMA and I didn't take enough so the roll was wavey...and then the next time I did it I took more and it blew me away.

"419",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Here's my report!My long-time friend (let's call him J) and I have been wanting to try mushrooms for a while now but have been worried about the nausea associated with eating them and the fact that they are hard to conceal in the mail. We both smoke marijuana regularly and in terms of psychedelic experience have each tried LSD twice (together both times with his girlfriend babysitting us).I found a reputable vendor of liquid mushrooms online (let's call him ""TripWithScience"") and ordered one vial (supposedly the equivalent of 2.2g) for J and I to split since it was our first time and didn't want to be overwhelmed. Trip advised that we each consume one whole vial for a nice relaxing time and generously threw in a second vial with my order for free and told me about it after it shipped :-)Â  Shipping was fast and very stealthy.We had planned out our day a couple weeks in advance to go on a camping trip but something unexpected came up the day before so we had to cancel. We still ended up doing it that weekend just a bit differently than we had originally planned.I drove over to J's house early Sunday morning and got there around 630am and his girlfriend cooked us all a nice fresh breakfast we sat down to eat together and get comfortable by talking about the day ahead of us. We took out two cups (one for each of us) and each mixed one vial in about an ounce of lemon juice. We let it dissolve for almost an hour then mixed in a couple ounces of orange juice to maker it easier to drink.We left the house around 730am with the drinks in hand on our way to a large outdoor park a few miles down the road. We brought towels waters snacks etc. for our little ""picnic"". We got to the park said cheers to eachother and drank the concoction then started a five minute walk from the car to our final destination where we would all be hanging out. Our spot that we had already picked out was a nice field with small rolling hills and well manicured golf course style grass overlooking a nice lake with lots of big trees and some wildlife.The mushrooms effects started to really kick in around the 30min mark (because we took it on a full stomach). It was a very strange sensation almost like a very stoned feeling but with a different headspace. It started out with a pleasant body high almost like eating a cannabis edible and a fun case of laughter. We both commented that we had noticed some slight nausea but it wasn't terrible at all. Could possibly be attributed to using too much lemon juice or having a stomach full of scrambled eggs and bacon?After a little while as the effects kept creeping up on me I started to see the world a little bit differently nothing too overwhelming or any ridiculous hallucinations like what you see on television. Nature and the world started to look a lot more serene and beautiful with colors and details appearing a lot more vivid.I laid down and stared at the clouds by myself for a little bit while J was off walking around somewhere and I noticed some wonderful open eye visuals. The clouds began to morph a bit as they moved through the sky forming different patterns in them. The visuals weren't as crazy as taking LSD but it was still very interesting to me as I got lost in my thoughts staring at the sky. I had a lot of introspective thoughts as I had hoped for and expected. I thought a lot about some personal things I want to change in my life and how I am going to go about changing into those certain directions. Once the effects were fully kicked in and we were comfortable in our new state we went and walked around for a little while exploring some trails then went and sat back down and all just talked for a little while.After being out at the park for about 2 hours it was approaching noon and it was starting to get hot out so J's girlfriend drove us all back to their house. We hung out inside and smoked a bit which seemed to bring the effects back a little bit stronger and I noticed some more visual distortions. We all just relaxed and talked about a variety of things for the next few hours. We parted ways and I went home so we could all nap for a couple hours then we regrouped later that evening to talk about our experience and conclusions after having some alone time to think about it.My evaluation after:Firstly I had a great time overall.It was not as ridiculous as taking a dose of acid in terms of the mindfuck and lack of attention. The visuals I noticed were almost near the level of my prior acid trips but the racing thoughts and sense of being overwhelmed were not present. I almost felt stoned from the start and was very relaxed the whole time which was very nice since my only prior experience with a psychedelic is LSD which is much more ""in your face""I understand that I did a relatively low dose of mushrooms and can see how powerful they are. I'd like to try them again some time but maybe do double the dose for a more intense journey. Even though it wasn't a crazy 12 hour trip I still feel that I learned a lot and it helped me finalize some decisions about certain things that have been weighing on my mind and stressing me out lately.","psychedelics","959",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

My boyfriend myself and a close friend all took 1 tab each around noon. The come up took about 30 minutes to hit. Unfortunately it made me feel very sick...I kept getting extremely strong waves of nausea for at least an hour so much so that it ended up making me very anxious about tripping for the first time so the beginning of the trip was a little too intense for me. My boyfriend got a bit nauseous as well but not as much as me and my friend didn't feel much of a body load at all. When the nausea finally started to subside I finally started to enjoy the trip probably around 1:30/2pm... the visuals were intensely beautiful. I felt at peace with myself. The trip was highly euphoric and happy. We had gotten some fruit ahead of time and eating each piece was a wonderful and delicious experience I've never enjoyed a strawberry or grape so much. The 200ug dose was VERY strong and we were definitely knocked on our asses for a few hours taking the trip in. Around 5pm we were a little more put together and decided to venture outside - I live in a large apartment building in a big city so it made getting to nature a little more of an adventure. We walked to the water front took in the sky line of the city sat and stared at the water the beach rocks etc... I'm so glad we were able to get out into nature because it added to the experience so much. Everything was beyond beautiful. The visuals of the trip for me lasted until after midnight. Although we did smoke some weed at night so maybe that intensified what was left of them. Overall this experience with LSD made me realize nothing is what it seems and there is a whole other way to experience all my senses- taste sound sight etc. I am a very anxious person and Tessellated's LSD made me feel euphoric and peaceful... even now a few days later I am still in a very positive head space.

I have not eaten a 2c-b dose this low before and each time I have had 2c-b it was all from the same stock and was most definitely a bit too much like all of those RC tryptamines available on the Clearnet. I really find an extremely hard time trying to get how people say 2c-b is anything like LSD + MDMA. It makes me think that there's not a huge amount of people that have candyflipped before. If anything 2c-b is a mixture of 4-aco-dmt or 4-ho-met and 30 mg adderall. It has mushroom qualities not LSD characteristics. The visuals are low dose psilocin visuals. 2c-b always feels like it's missing something similar to every other RC. 2c-b is different however because of it's dose response curve. You can add 5mg and the trip changes. 5 more and it's a completely different experience. This is a substance that needs to be dosed high when you want to get close to true psychedelia. BV's 2c-b is powerful as fuck. Try not to mis-dose it unless you have been to the 25-40mg realm. 25mg of BV's bee will have your body and mind melting. The most similar thing to 30mg of 2c-b is a flowerflip at the doseages 130mg MDMA + 2 grams mushrooms. When you dose low you will have a small peak of about 1.5 hours and about 1 hour of very comfortable stimulation not unlike low dose MDMA. The aftermath has a feeling of mushrooms. Personally I feel this almost heaviness in my sinuses and my front skull - not uncomfortable but present just like I do on anything psilocin based. 2c-b is actually very much like Mescaline as well. Slightly similar visually with a very similar headpsace.","psychedelics","353",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"423",NA,"the official lsd vendor review","Absolutely LOVED the House Brand from BlueViking. It was my first trip but I have NEVER felt so much love and euphoria as I did on one tab. It was obviously a light experience but it was a great nightcap at UMF with great friends. I suppose it was essentially a candyflip because I took it on the downside of my roll after the festival. Either way it was just...indescribable.A couple of friends ended up with AlbertHoffman1943's(I believe thats the full name) tabs from SMP from like October. They were vac sealed in the freezer the entire time. They had a great time one buddy said he was originally disappointed with visuals until he went back to his temp residence. He said the visuals just exploded and he tripped absolute balls. I forgot to ask if he smoked or not but I'm assuming not.Just ordered more of the House Brand and hoping to use soon!","psychedelics","155",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However our services rely on Heartbleed vulnerable TLS(SSL) connections such as for secure SMTP/POP3/IMAP connections to our servers.Perhaps most concerning is that this security exploitation has existed for roughly two years. This is one of the results when government entities which in our opinion have known about this exploit - yet did nothing to warn and prevent it. The researchers who found this exploit have estimated that over 66% of ALL web servers and TLS services are affected by this bug.Due to this very serious bug in the TLS protocol we decided to take our services offline until all our services have been patched. In addition due to the way the Heartbleed Bug leaks memory information it is possible that our server IP address an location were compromised. We cannot be certain that our backup server location is safe either.After a thorough review of our logs we have not detected any suspicious activity however we must assume and proceed on the basis that our server locations could have been compromisedWe are proactively moving to freshly installed and patched servers at a new location to guarantee our continued anonymous and private service.This process is time consuming and we are working around the clock to have our service running 24/7 ASAP.We expect Lelantos to be online again by April 10th.Lelantos exists to provide private anonymous e-mail service.

"427",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Finally had the chance to try my first purchase with BV being the 150ug house brand tabs. As I was tripping very heavily from the experience I did not take notes so I will try to give as accurate and to the point trip report as possible but please excuse the lack of time info as I stopped paying attention to the time after everything got started.  To date the the best acid experience I have ever had from a silk road vendor has been Peaceful's 150ug house brand this is why I bought what I did. In the past the perfect for me has been 3 x 15oug tabs straight away at the start with no re-dosing throughout the trip. On this particular occasion my friends that I was with were all taking varying amounts of Nb combo blotters. For me I usual take 2 x 1000ug tabs with an extra 1000ug tab about half an hour in when the very visuals become very obvious.  After waiting an hour and seeing my friends tripping very heavily I only felt mildly spacey but no visuals so in classic 'me form' impatience I decided that I should have another 150ug tab. Of course the visuals from the previous 450ug kicked in about 15 minutes later. This would have started around 4:00pm and I wasn't completely sober without any residual visuals until around midnight but still had a slight body high feeling.  Once the full 600ug of the trip was in effect for the first time ever I experienced mild synesthesia which I have always been very curious about. For those of you that don't know what that is its a condition whereby ones sense become mixed up eg sound appears to be visual certain letters or words can appear to have colors and images can form tastes. Interesting piece of trivia Nikola Tesla lived with the condition most of his life.   During the peak of the trip I found myself in a small study room in my house with one other person and I constantly kept forgetting what I was trying to say half way through sentences and the colors I was seeing was overwhelming.   Only at one point I think about 3 hours in (I kind of lost the the ability to understand and comprehend time) did I get that sense of this is a bit too much and when will it end have I gone too far this time etc that a lot of people tend to feel towards the end of their trips. These negative feelings never overcame me though as I still had enough control to be able to avoid that negative mind set which some will know is a downward spiral if you fall into that trap. This 'moment' of negativity was honestly only a passing moment and in no way a reflection of the quality of the acid IMHO.   After the peak was easing off my friends and settle into watching some movies and eating food like it was the greatest thing I had ever tasted lol!  After about 9 hours I tried to go to sleep as I was not getting any residual visuals but still a slight spacey body high sort of feeling and I was not able to get to sleep for at least another 3-4 hours.   All in all I felt very clean the next day and actually had a really good sleep without any xanny assistance. Final verdict being THANK YOU BV for taking the time to recommend this particular product to me I will buying more and look forward to comparing it to some of your other popular listings when you are back from vacation mode.  Oh and I almost forgot the stealth was not only amazing but also ironic. For those of you that suffer from darknet paranoia relax if my package had of been opened it would have still been sent to me without a doubt.   Hope this vague trip report was constructive for those of you that are interested.","psychedelics","678",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"428",NA,"pcp & lsd trip report (combined) holy fucking shit!!!","just two days ago I acquired some pcp and 2 hits of acid. I'm well aware of the dangers of pcp but I've tripped on acid and dissosiatives multiple times and shrooms once. I've taken acid in mild amounts with dissosiatives as well. Since it was my first time using PCP I tried too consume a low amount. I dropped the 2 hits of acid about 15 minutes after taking the pcp and went to a big park near me which is a really nice park tranquil I thought this would be a good setting. I planned on just taking it easy walking around the park sitting down or if need be I could lay down in the grass. Everything was going fine until about an hour after dropping the acid. It took me about 15 minutes to get to the park. So I'd been walking around for about 45 minutes. I was walking on the grass between the trees just on the outskirts of a big open area of grass. I was very interested in the trees stopping in front of them and just staring at them for long periods of time. I felt like I'd been in the park for maybe 15 minutes probably because I was stopping to look at trees for so long and they were really interesting to me so it didn't feel like a long time. I thought I noticed someone standing in the area of open grass staring at me but I wasn't paying attention. Eventually I noticed they'd been staring at me for a long time so I turned to see this person and there standing in the middle of the park was a fucking orangutan. I stared for maybe 2 mins just taking in the sight. He would not stop staring at me and it was starting to creep me out so I began walking over to him. I was aware that I was tripping but it looked so real that I just had to walk over to him to get a better look. When I got maybe 3 feet away and stopped he motioned with his finger to come closer just like a person would. I was very weary about getting any closer to it but I could not resist hearing what a fucking ORANGUTAN had to say. He said in this really weird soft voice ""I can speak I wanna speak to you I've got something to say"" I walked to its side keeping maybe half a foot away from him but close enough to hear him speak.He said and I shit you not""I wanna get fucked up""To me it sounded really stupid like something out of some retarded teen movie. But I decided that this was my trip I should go with what happens on it not avoid its most compelling features. I started to feel really far gone as we walked towards a bench. I don't remember the details of what happened next just that I gave the orangutan PCP. I can remember thinking that I'd gone back in time and met some primitive form of man. Next thing I remember after this is being in a bar and telling the bartender to get the orangutan whatever he wants. I think I'd somehow forgotten that I was tripping at this point I just wanted to get fucked up with the orangutan. Maybe half an hour of doing shots with an orangutan later some guys at the other end of the bar started yelling shit at him. He went over to them and a fight broke out. I rushed over and in the middle of the brawl throwing punches at the dudes who were yelling at my orangutan the orangutan started throwing punches at ME. I was think why the fuck is this orangutan hitting me I got him fucked up like he wanted spent a shit load of money getting him whatever drinks he wanted and gave him PCP. The cops arrive both me and the orangutan were arrested and I blacked out. I came to in a jail cell and then I was taken out to be booked since I was too fucked up to be booked when they brought me in. Well it turns out that the orangutan was not really an orangutan at all.Did I hallucinate the whole thing I hear you ask? No. It turns out that this orangutan was A FUCKING RETARDED KID.Yes I gave PCP to a retarded kid and got him drunk. I had noPCP left on me but we were both drug tested. So I have been charged with giving drugs and alcohol to a mentally infirm minor. DON'T DO PCP JUST DON'T DO IT. I don't want to sound like I'm spewing some DEA bullshit but PCP is definitley a drug which is not worth it. In my cell I remember observing myself from up above. I felt like I was in a dream or a movie or some shit. I felt like I could go 100 miles and hour in a car and completely total it and crash with no seatbelt and I'd actually survive the crash because I'm just dreaming. If anything happens I'll wake up from the dream no harm done. I then started throwing punches at the cell not knowing what the fuck I was doing by the time I came down the police told me I was lucky to even survive that combination. DO NOT FUCK WITH THIS DAMN SUBSTANCE IT IS THE MOST FUCKED UP SHIT YOU'LL EVER EXPERIENCE IN YOUR LIFE.","psychedelics","930",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This will be my first year participating. On the subject of LSD... has anyone else ever wondered what the world might be like if the US crack epidemic would have been substituted with LSD instead of crack cocaine? Like if LSD has spread like wild fire throughout America's inner cities and poor neighborhoods rather than crack cocaine during the mod-late 1980's. I realize the dynamics and driving forces behind crack cocaine's proliferation were totally different and this may not have been possible with LSD. But just imagine they were for a second. Imagine the type of impact an LSD epidemic may have had on poor urban areas then and how the results of that may have manifested up to present day. I'm not really sure how that would have played out exactly but I think it would have been positive at the very least. Like youth flashing peace signs to eachother instead of gang signs for example.

Everyone in the group seemed to agree the tabs were much lower dosage than we're used to getting from tessellated. I have 7 coming right now and hopefully those will be at the previous potency.

Though consider that people with chronic tolerance probably also were included in the data.""QuoteThose who do very high doses often are also likely to find radically different effects due to tolerance.The general understanding is that you should wait at least 2 weeks 14 days between trips to be at baseline (ie not requiring double or triple the dose to achieve the same effects). Most would agree that the longer the better to allow the 'magic' to return'. Most also understand that rX drugs will play a part in how LSD affects someone specifically benzos opiates ssri's etc.I think the concern people have been voicing have been that they are taking these things into account and are noticing a difference in their trip outcomes versus prior orders. I do not believe that it would be right to automatically assume it's all the end-user's fault due to set/setting or other drug use just as I do not believe it would be right to assume that the vendor has quality control issues. There's no way to know for sure either way unless someone (reputable) did conduct a real lab test and provided the results.I think that everyone who is interested in LSD should take a break from all psychs and other drugs (except weed as that doesn't necessarily have a negative effect like benzo or opiate use would) eat right exercise get a nice comfortable/happy set and setting (and mood!) and then try a sufficient dosage THEN judge. I unfortunately end up having something going against me at any given time (ie lack of sleep/exercise or other drug use) so I can't say for sure anything. I am currently taking a break from all other drugs except weed and plan on taking a 4 hit trip saturday. Add in exercise + lots of sleep throughout this week along with supplementation (coconut oil hemp oil protein vitamins etc.) = I should be in a very good spot w/my health/mind/body to accurately judge the intensity of a 4 hit trip (which is per T a 800ug dose)","psychedelics","378",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"436",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","This is erowid... but for your paranoia: Copypasta    How long does blotter LSD last? Is wrapping it in foil and putting it in the freezer a reasonable storage method?A:    The primary catalysts for the decomposition of LSD are heat light oxygen and moisture. LSD's shelf life can be significantly extended if exposure to these are minimized.Air & LightKeeping LSD in an air and light proof container is the most important step. A good option is a dark amber glass container kept somewhere cool. Remember most plastic (plastic bags) is not air tight though it's a lot better than nothing. Likewise keeping blotter in foil isn't going to stop air transfer but it's also better than nothing. If glass isn't available a combination of foil and plastic would be more effective than either one alone.TemperatureLSD will degrade even at room temperature but the hotter the temperature and the longer it is stored in a hot location the more it will degrade. At room temperature degredation is quite slow so a cool room out of the sun is generally enough to minimize break-down. Storing blotter in the refrigerator or freezer is fine but is probably unnecessary.MoistureIf blotter is stored somewhere cold (as opposed to cool) it should be allowed to return to room temperature before being opened as this will prevent condensation from forming. Also if the weather is extremely humid storing LSD with a little bit of dessicant (drying agent) can ensure that it stays dry.If these storage methods are followed blotter should last for many years. Foil in the freezer is a common storage method and should be effective at keeping degradation to a minimumfor a few years.","psychedelics","277",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I really enjoy everyone's trip reports and especially like when people compare each crystal. One of the most amazing parts about this whole community is that we all get to discuss our experiences with these exact same products. On websites like bluelight or shroomery discussions can happen but only in general mostly because everyone has a different source. I enjoy sharing and listening about entheogenic experiences about as much as I enjoy experiencing entheogens themselves!I agree what you say about the House xtal being mystical and i don't think I would trip with others except only my closest friends it does get very deeply introspective. It took me a day or two to recover all of my energy from the trip but I especially noticed the medicinal aspect the House crystal 2 or 3 days after the trip and a couple good sleeps. I could feel a shroud of light around my aura. Like a protective light sheild around me and it helped me to feel very calm and safe and I still have that sense now a week later.I notice that the House xtal really energized and vibrated my crown and ajna (third eye) chakra. It was actually somewhat alarming at first because the crown chakra is often the most intense chakra to activate and does not seem to happen often for me at least. This goes along with thinking of the House xtal as being very mystical and as someone pointed out a few pages back a blessed crystal.The SR 277ug print energized my navel and heart chakras more similar to Jannis's dolphins.","psychedelics","272",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A lot of times I find myself distracted by visuals and I just want to trip for the headspace. Some of the best acid I've ever had were Jannis's Dolphins (the ones he was selling right before SR1 went down) and I found those not very visual but it was the most amazing headspace I've ever gotten from acid (or maybe any other drug too). Also I find that people totally underestimate just how subjective of a drug that LSD is. One time 3 friends and I all took a 300ug trip on Tess's stuff and 3 of us were fine and had a great time but one of my friends had an ego death and later told me that he became a orb of light at the center of the universe and could see the entire universe in a 360 degree view. I find that the best way to go into a LSD experience is to expect nothing and just let it take you where you need to go.                                                                                                                            - Alice Dee","psychedelics","271",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"441",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Ok I have tripped on Tessellated's stuff couple of times recently and I can say: the ones that I got were not even close to 200ug. I had amazing trips on 2 or 3 hits but they were not even near what should be expected on 400ug and 600ug respectively. I mean Set and Setting are important but how can it make 400ug looks like 150ug?? For me this is some BS of someone trying to close its eyes and reject to see where the real problem lies. I do believe Tessellated is a good guy and has good intentions but when a lot of people start complaining about your product being weak: it's a clear sign that something is wrong. Don't blame it on Set and Setting or medications because that's just not the case for a lot of us - including me.I have not tripped on his old stuff since I'm a newbie on SilkRoad but I know that some people had it tested a long time ago and the dosage was 200ug but that's just not the reality now. More recent tests (that were even posted here) measured Tessellated's LSD to be close to 33ug. And the answer from Tessellated? ""Well this is impossible... look at these trip reports"" (also note that he gives extra hits in exchange for reports). But why the guys that had it tested would lie about that while the other vendors got some decent results? I don't know. From my experience I believe that the ones I got in two different ocasions were aroung 60ug. What I actually realized is that most of Tessellated feedback is something like ""didn't try the product yet... but seems awesome"" or something similar and no updates are made most of the times. But to be fair I have read a lot of good trip reports (mostly in this topic) which makes me think that this is a problem with only some recent or specific batches.Some friends have tripped on the same stuff and reached the same conclusions and I strongly believe that some buyers (like myself) didn't want the trouble of registering getting 50 posts and posting here (going against everyone by themselves as a newbie) so they just decide to stay silent even though they had similar experiences. The only thing that made me come up to post this was the increasingly reports of the same nature.","psychedelics","402",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"442",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","So its been over 4 weeks and I finally tried tripping again since my psychedelic experiences have been going tiredly. Trip:42mg 2cb(I wanted to match the same exact mg as when I did Nawlins 2cb in order to compare)Setting:Same as my previous 2cb trip  outside sunny weatherReport:Come up - None. Zero. Took about 60-75 minutes to kick in..It was a bit hard to tell..Visually this 2cb left me pretty much in dissapointment. When me and my friend looked at our eyes they were constricted.  I'm wondering if being out in the sun killed the visuals?  Tracers were a tiny bit there clouds would slightly deform a bit and some closed eye visuals but nothing really wow.Audio sounded very good. Very enjoyable with my friend alot of songs were so comforting or exciting and so on.  One thing that I did love is that it didn't give me the famous ""Where the fuck did the bass go?!"" effect. Usually 2cb makes the bass go away big time. But on the bad side it didn't really wow me like other 2cb has.Headspace is simply astonishing on this. I could be tripping and enjoying myself and not be confused. Energy was great and man...it was nice being ""happy"" again in a trip. It's been a while since I had those empathy feelings in my chest where I wish I had more of my friends around to enjoy this with.  Me and my friend were in an extremely positive mood the entire trip the stories characters it was so much fun to go on to thinking about things that came off from other thoughts . Now its been about 6 hours later and I'm incredibly relaxed and just full of positivity. It feels like a cleansing. After this is done I'm going to go enjoy the night out with friends and just be in love with it all even though the 2cb is done its afterglow is great. At a few times during the trip I almost cried thinking of how beautiful everything was and selfishly how it was nice for me to have a nice trip again. After the abuse of psychedelics and god knows the last time I had a happy trip from start to end this was maybe just the trip I needed instead of the one I was looking for with visuals. Side effects were non existant usually my teeth hurt mentally I'm cloudy/tired as shit. Biggest thing this 2cb did was dry out my mouth a tiny bit. Positives:At high dosages there were no side effectsHeadspace / Mental Clarity makes it incredibly easy if you want to get creative aka painting bike rides walkingetc. No need to worry about confusion with 2cb. Very nice empathy boosts its that warm loving feeling bursting out of your chest god I love it. Come up / Come down - ehhh what are those? You just go into it and you come out of it happy. Short - 1 1/2 hour total trip. Negatives:Visuals were almost non-existant.50/50:Audio while it did sound good  it didn't give me that real wow that 2cb gives.Conclusion:Blue is an awesome vendor quick shippinggreat stealth. His 2cb is just different than what I may be used to or maybe wanting? If I want to do creative stuff like painting or activities like bicycling or still being able to talk around people I think this 2cb is def what I would use. For an all out spectator show to your eyes/ears I still find it that Nawlins 2cb is still hands down king for that but Nawlins does come with its negatives such as side effects in the higher range headspace is def much more confused and I don't really get that empathy feel in my chest.But I am still interested in one more trip with this 2cb seeing as my eyes were constricted with me and my friend I wonder if the visual aspect needs another try and why the constricted pupils happened.","psychedelics","666",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"443",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","Eh I will say this much. I've placed numerous orders from Tess dating back to the end of 2013 until now. I did have one order where the batch seemed surprisingly weak but I can't say for certain that the tabs were 100% for sure weak tabs because I also mess around with opiates and benzos not often but sometimes I don't pay attention to when I take them (say a day or two before a trip) and I know they can directly affect the intensity of trips...so I can't say one way or the other but there are numerous reports now from multiple - not just 1 or 2 people - that they received weak tabs.So I placed another order.Yesterday was my 'biggest' trip at 4 tabs or ~800ug advertised dose.I had previously about a month ago taken 3 hits. I was very underwhelmed on that trip as I was not where I ""wanted to be"" in regards to body feelings visuals thoughts OEVs CEVs etc. Again I'm not pointing the finger because the finger may need pointed at myself.SO knowing that I went with 4 hits.I EXTREMELY underestimated it. Jesus HOLY FUCKING Christ. (Happy Easter!)I have been speaking with someone very well versed on LSD to help me understand what happened. I came very very VERY close to experiencing TRUE ego death. My brain lit up with sounds - not from music or outside sources but from inside. Buzzing and what seemed like radio wave signals bouncing around in my head. Ominus tones that would propel me from consciousness to unconsciousness where I wasn't sure where I was who I was or that I was even me as at the time the experience was the only thing that mattered.By far last night was one of the most profound intense and astonishing trips/moments of my ENTIRE LIFE.As far as batches go there was a grand canyon of differences between the 3 hits I took a month ago and the 4 I did yesterday. Given this was a pretty big dose increase but I didn't expect that vast differences I experienced. I took it at 145 and by 2-210 I was full blown balls to the wall tripping.As of now I have a pretty nice stock of L so I won't need to reorder anytime soon but I plan on returning some business to T as he has done me right anytime I had any problem.","psychedelics","406",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"444",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","This is the best explanation I've ever seen regarding ego death from a very well educated individual:Recently a few people have asked me about ""ego death"" over on my facebook page and I've seen a few posts here mentioning it.There seems to be a few misconceptions out there so let me try to clear it up.Ego death is a specific experience that can occur on high doses of psychedelics (such as LSD; but by no means limited to LSD).A lot of people describe any powerful psychedelic experience as 'ego death'. This is wrong. You can have extremely powerful experiences without ego death.Other people describe the sudden realisation of one's place in the universe (tiny and insignificant) as ego death. This is also wrong.Yet more people describe powerful ""bad trips"" where they experience something akin to their own death as ""ego death"". Also this is wrong.These misunderstandings come from a false understanding of the phrase. ""Ego"" in this case doesn't mean egotistical it simply means ""the self"".What the experience of ego death is is the loss of the sense of self entirely. The words ""I"" ""me"" ""myself"" and so on have no meaning in this state. Normally you can divide the world in to ""myself"" and ""everything outside of myself"". When experiencing ego death the ""myself"" part is gone. Everything else is still there (potentially the real world; potentially a fantasy world) but YOU are not. The experience still exists and when your ego returns the ""you"" that has come back can (usually) remember the environment that was but has no way to explain - even to itself - what it was that experienced that environment.It's a very difficult experience to explain of course; because human languages are totally unsuited to the explanation of an environment without something experiencing it (the idea of ""looking at"" or ""hearing"" or ""feeling"" are all experiences that 'someone' has. Without a 'someone' how do you describe it?).If someone talks about an ego death experience and says ""I saw..."" or especially ""I felt..."" they're not talking about ego death. The kinds of words that someone might use would be more along the lines of ""there was..."". Not ""I felt at peace"" but ""there was peace"". Not ""I saw light"" but ""there was light"".I've experienced ego death a total of 5 times in my life and I remember each one vividly to this day. It's not scary as it's happening because there is no ""you"" to be scared. The first time I experienced it I was extremely scared afterwards - I had no idea how to explain it to myself. Once I processed it I became more comfortable with it and now I can honestly say I look forward to the next time.","psychedelics","456",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

K so let's say at some point this weekend I had a pretty big event roll through town with awesome visual effects and great sound. Anyway...the last time I took 2cb about 2 weeks ago I dosed 40mg and most of my friends took either 30 or 40mg. I had a dissociated feeling for sure but visuals were mediore and it was a great time either way. Finished that 2cb and everyone wanted another shot at it. So...I ordered some with my bicycle day sale prints and got it in record time. Anyway...I ended up dosing anywhere from 40-about 45/46mg by accident. I wasnt 40mg because of last week but the extra wasn't on purpose. Anyway...I dosed my friends slightly lower than the previous week just to be ""safe"". Yikes. Everyone but me lost their shit. I mean it was overwhelming at times...and that only ting I can say is it somehow felt like i was in a video game but everyone was like cyborg from Mortal Kombat. About at hour 3 I dropped a house tab with 2 of my really close lady friends that I enjoy tripping with immensely. Shit got fucking weird from there on out. Visuals did not stop until almost 10am this morning and I took a xanax at 430am. I was able to lay down and close my eyes but not sure I even slept. Such a great combo...I fucking love all of you.Two weird things for me: Some people took 3 to 4 hours to fully hit their ""trip"". My buddy didnt get it until he was unfortunately on his way home. The other weird thing is I feel FUCKING AMAZING today. Like I slept for a week and am just so incredibly happy about everything.

Now imagine a brain that has never listened to lets say shpongle. That brain has no idea of how to enjoy that it doesnt have the personality to be able to enjoy it with a bias.

"447",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","277ug SR Print review:I have to say that this substance never seazes to amaze me i learn more and more each time i drop.. it's amazing really.I dropped one SR print tab at midnight going into bicycle day. I had the perfect setting especially because since my last trip i've been decorating my room to give it the maximum psychedelic vibe and I have to say thats it's amazing to far! I browsed the net for around 30 minutes until i felt that famous tingling sensation that I always feel when I'm coming up so I decided it was time to lay down and put some headphones on. My music of choice for my peak this time were shpongle albums it was my first time listening to them while tripping. I have to say that the after i laid down the next 3 hours were AMAZING. Shpongle was messing with my mind and conciousness SO hard their music was literally taking me to another dimension.. One of the walls in my room is full of glow in the dark stars lit by a black light this sight was orgasmic it was so surreally beuatiful the stars were moving and spinning across the whole wall. But what really stood out to me on this trip were the COV's words can't begin to describe what I was seeing just the most beautiful out of this world fractals mandalas chakras i can't even put what i was seeing into words.. shpongle was really taking me out of this world just amazing.. it was literally a journey I'm sure any of you whos listened to shpongle while peaking can say that their music is just fucking incredible it takes you places (I love the name of one of their albums tales of the inexpressible because thats really what it is just inexpressible..). After a good 3 hours of just straight up tripping face in my room I got complete ego death (as i always do past 250ug) their music became really scary and I just could not take it anymore it got way too dark for a person on complete ego death it scared the living shit out of me! You all know that bone chilling feeling when you get on that downward spiral and you just cannot seem to come back music will not comfort you anymore everything is just plain out scary (mostly because of the type of music i was listening to). That's when I decided that I needed to get help from my SO she always brings me back from those downward spirals. After she calmed me down a bit the magic of the trip came back i put some groovy ass roots reggae on and was just enjoying the visuals her face and skin covered in beautiful looking fractals all over. I was just feeling overwhelming love at this point. We started talking about our lives being completely open with each other crying just an amazing time to be honest. I find lsd to be so therapeutically effective its so humbling. I started pondering about life and just thinking about people and how our plan here on this earth is to help people better themselves thats what lsd is all about to me at least. I just see all this love as a chain effect because by me being a good person helping people better themselves and stop being selfish it's going to bring out the same effect on them it's going to want them help other people and so on its a never ending cycle.. It makes me sad that a lot of people take this substance for granted people want to drop crazy amounts of acid just to trip out and not even learn anything from it.. that's why im VERY particular of who I trip with nowadays especially because I get ego death pretty easily and I absolutely NEED comforting and loving people with me when I'm on a scary ego death or else I get super introspective and all get kinds of bad feelings. It's so hard to put all this into words too ugh!Back to the trip report. After I got back on my groove my SO went back to sleep and I decided it was time to go outside! that was at about 5am I was coming down so the visuals werent as intense as on the peak (dont get me wrong they were stil NICE and fractally just not as insane as the peak haha). I went on a walk to the 24/7 grocery store and it was so much fun looking at the trees outside the crazy fractals on the wet pavement just an awesome time overral. Once I got to the store I went inside bought some fruits said hi and talked to the janitor who was cleaning the place a bit because he seemed a little down I was just in such a great mood that I wanted to pass that to other people. After that i went outside the store on their front patio and sat down by the place where they showcase their flowers and sat there for a good 40 minutes eating fruit and enjoying the view until I decided to go back home. Once home I took a nice shower and went to lay down and think about the crazy trip that I had had. Ended up going to bed at around 9 so the trip lasted the usual 8-10 hours for me.All in all I LOVED this tab I think I've found my sweet spot on dosage (boy am I glad I grabbed a good bit of these on the sale  ) would recommend it to anyone GREAT acid.Â  BV thank you so much for proving us with this beautiful substance that you have you and the crew are the bee's knees forreal!I hope everyone had a great 4/20 and bicycle day.

"449",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","It might be cheating of a sorts to use my Ket experiences to explain ego death since that is the nature of dissociative substances but I wrote up my perspective on how to describe a k-hole in the philosophy section:Using Ketamine to achieve a profound level of dissociation is a very unique experience. You feel as though you have been reduced to an almost ""primal"" state where you become a third person observer of your own existence. You are and are not you at the same time. Lose yourself to it completely and you feel as of you have become part of everything while at the same time thinking that nothing exists at all. Take it a level further and you realize that existence is eternal and unending yet what would exist if nothing existed at all?  At that point of non existing is the ""K-hole""I would welcome the opportunity to achieve ego death with LSD;  the length of my ego death was undetermined as I truly felt immersed in the experience. I have no idea how long it lasted other than the Ket session was full-on ego death in about 10 minutes. I remember feeling like a primal vibration joining the greater universal vibration. I was no longer me.  If you haven't experienced true ego death whether it's been with LSD K shrooms etc. I highly recommend it.  Don't be intimidated - just be careful and know yourself and your limits.Bringing it back into the theme of this thread I believe that ego death would be possible with 750ug of the High White house blotters. What would be the duration of this experience I wonder?  It was profound with K and I was able to come away from it with much personal spiritual growth and have been enjoying all of my gear with a keener intense connection since then instead of how I used to just feel good or ""get high"" in the past. If K has been a good teacher I can only imagine how incredible of a teacher LSD would be.  I believe BV's stuff would be the perfect key to unlock that door","psychedelics","357",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One put me in an intense trip and had tons of epiphanies. Wish I had bought more. Ten strip wasn't enough. Saving 2 for outdoor summer fun. Quick come up and very nice afterglow. 2. BV House blotter 150ug- Very clean and enjoyable. Took 2 or 3 to get me at a great level of trippyness. I got a bunch more coming and can't wait. I really liked the blotter art.Â 3. Silkroad Blotter 277ug- Was expecting more out of these blotters but overall was good. More natural and mellow feeling. Wasn't as intense as I would like it but had a very friendly head space. I took it by itself once and also mixed with 2 house blotters and I must say those two different types of blotters mixed was amazing. Calm but very zippy if that makes sense. 4. Czech Silver 125ug- Very nice trip but needed more to get the job done. Comparable to house blotter but you just need more of it. Def a good buy for how cheap they are. I mainly used it to supplement my larger dosed blotters. I did reagent lsd drug test these blotters because my friend said it made his mouth numb (but he is a noob) but the test said it was def LSD which I thought it was anyway. Just nice to know I got some lsd test kits now if I ever do have to buy off the streets. but BV is my main man now. Love all his LSDOverall I loved all the blotters.

I've gone to raves on like 1000 ug and candyflipping is sort of neccesary to make such a high dose suit the setting for me. I can move around and rave no problem but thats because Im just having a good time enjoying music and females and not having to think about much or anything at all.If I trip at home and come up on the couch Im pretty much stuck to the couch minus cig breaks. During the come up and peak its like my insides are vibrating so hard that I cant do much mechanical shit( Cracking Nitrous whip its is a task but a worthwhile one that I accomplish). This complication is further compounded by the fact that my vision is so twisty/morphy and full of visuals that packing a bowl or loading a whip it or taking a dab or just anything becomes a true task of effort.Â  I feel the visuals high dosage provides is just beyond worth the intenseness.I will say for me at least high dosages only matter until the peak. After the peak the trip calms down quite a bit and is no different than say a 500ug or so trip at that point. The peak is where the intensity lays for me from high doses.But I've done high doses in places like raves and amusement parks and though I often wanted to find a bench had no problem going about the day normally  with a really fun kick.

I gave it a full two week break laid off the clonazepam for a bit and had a very lovely trip just as impressive as my last 3 on this stuff. Minimal anxiety on the comeup intense peak and nothing but love and pure wonder thereafter. Absolutely no bodyload whatsoever (which I seem to be more sensitive to than most based on other reports from others on other sources of LSD). Eating food felt like making love- so delicious and erotic. Like passionate rough sex. Watched a breathtaking sunset and intricate dance of clouds above condensing and evaporating into thin air before complex mandela-like tapestries in the blue sky above. Had the most amazing night ride through the warm air under bright stars above. Sadly that was my last tab. Can't wait to get more of this though I may hold out for the ALD-52 (or both).It's hard for me to fathom anything more perfect that this LSD but I've read and heard some legendary stories about ALD-52 (aka orange sunshine) directly from some some folks who tried it in the 70's.

Another marquis test done on the tabs resulted in a light purplish color which I cannot match to any chemical on any reaction chart I have found. I would encourage everyone interested to read about the florescent properties of LSD and to buy a small inexpensive blacklight of their own. (Although someone might easily add quinine to tabs to make them florescence.)How common is it for SR LSD users to use multiple tests on their tabs? Just ehlrich alone is clearly not enough verification. I should mention that I have had other tabs in the past and the effects were different from these non-lsd tabs. These tabs put me in a blank headspace for days afterwards whereas regular LSD makes me very clear headed and feeling better the next day not worse. There was more body load on these tabs.

I added a small amout of quinine water to regular distilled water. Just that very little amount was enough to make the glass light up under UV light. I have to concluded that either the LSD is too old or is not LSD. Since it was active orally I think I must concluded that it was not LSD.

Going with Everclear or the highest % grain alcohol you can find is probably the best you can do. Dependant on the rate of hydrolysis (which I have no data for though SW did mention that it is slower than commonly thought","no idea what data he has though) you probably wouldn't find a large difference between ~90+ EtOH and anhydrous EtOH. I would think it would be more stable for long term storage blotter than in liquid form but I couldn't even give a guess at the time frames.","psychedelics",173,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I have been ordering from him since December back when his thread was no where near how big it is now maybe 17 or 18 pages. And I have been consistently reordering with him because of how much I like his product. Here's the thing anyone who has had their fair share of LSD whether it be street LSD or even on here can tell whether it's LSD very quickly by trying it. LSD has an extremely distinct feel to it I bet I could give some psychonauts DOx or 25i on WoW and ask them if it was LSD or not and they would know in a heartbeat. Thinking that a vendor as popular as BV isn't selling LSD would be like saying Tiffany's isn't selling real sterling silver.

Reading about the effects and different impact it has had on different people really doesn't prepare you for the full experience and what to expect (if such a thing can be even be said here). Wow!  This one really surprised me. I went in to the experience with a small preconception that I would be enjoying an innocent psychedelic and my previous exposure to 2CB was one other time with poor results due to whatever was the reason.  I came to the conclusion through further reading that  30mg seems to be the sweet spot with BV's gear. This was all taken on an empty stomach and after about 30 minutes I began to receive certain positive physical indicators that all was about to begin. At 60 minutes I was peaking very strongly with waves of euphoria and sensuality washing over me like almost rolling. Pupil dilation was extreme and overall sight became heavily influenced by hallucinations and strong visuals.  I am currently still enjoying this after 3 hours in and must say - Thanks BV!  You've got great products built upon solid integrity and professionalism.  So many things may change so quickly yet you have proven time and again that you remain constant.

But it was visually lacking. But the mind games and headspace was definitely on par with the 600+ugdose I took. Time stood still it seemd. Thot we were on the river for many more hours than we were.

Stealth:  10/10  BlueViking gets packages delivered in perfect stealth.Communication:  11/10  BlueViking has some the best customer service on the Dark Web. Product:  12/10  I took a week long tolerance break from all psychedelics and then ate one of BlueViking's 180µg tabs of ""Mayan"" LSD.  180µg is a pretty weak dose for me so I wasn't expecting much.  No I was not utterly blown away by the effects of the one tab but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  The effects were all just slightly more intense than what I expected and the effects were so wonderful.  Comfort smoothness and happiness are words that can't even begin to describe the overall high.  The come up of BlueViking's House Brand crystal is very comfortable but you do feel like something is coming.  The ""Mayan"" crystal's come up is almost not noticeable.  It's like you feel nothing then you feel more nothing then all of a sudden you realize you feel it all.   My one tab trip was not even close to the craziest or most intense trips of my life so far but I know it is a trip that will stick in my head.  The ""Mayan"" LSD simply made me feel a strong appreciation for all that we are.Overall:  11.54/10     I truly feel blessed to have gotten to try BlueViking's ""Mayan"" LSD.  My only regret is that I did not buy more.  Still I feel lucky to have two tabs of it left.  I'm saving those for the man that I love on the best day of our lives. BlueViking you really are doing a great service for us all.  I can never thank you enough for what you have done.  As always I look forwards to doing business with you again!","psychedelics","390",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"470",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Hey all.Tripped on the house whites last weekend. DAMN those things were good.  Here's my report!00:00 - Take my tab at home. I have plans to meet up with 2 friends we'll call them A & B. We had also planned on meeting up with another friend C later in the day. A has done acid numerous times as well however today would be B & C’s first time tripping. I felt good knowing they’d be tripping on some damn fine shit. I walk for about 15 minutes and meet up with them. We hang out for a bit on the side of the road and I give A his tab. Upon realizing we did not have speakers we walked back to my home.00:30 – Get the speakers grab some water and leave. I am beginning to feel the beginning stages of the trip (Acid hits me very quick I like it a lot). We find a good spot to hang out and set up for a few hours. An old abandoned house in the woods. The house has a nice deck with a cement base (So its safe) and we sat on top of that. 01:00 – I am at the early stages of the trip. Slight visual distortions are beginning here.  A reports the same. At this time B decides it’s time to take his tab. I took a few hits (2-3) of weed and sat back and waited for the rest of the acid to hit. (NOTE: I do not feel the need to smoke much while tripping during the first 4 hours. I find a few hits just helps to accelerate the trip)02:00 – I am tripping very hard. As I lay back on the (Dirty) deck I watch the branches above me. They appeared to be dancing around and changing shapes and patterns. It was here that I began to feel slightly overwhelmed by the acid. I feel this is largely due to a lower expectation of the acid. 02:30 – At this point I am reasonably overwhelmed at which point I began to panic slightly in my head. I say nothing to A or B who are both tripping as I do not want to concern them. B is enjoying himself so far. A is sitting largely motionless with me watching the trees.03:00 – C finally arrives. We give him his tab and then begin to explore the (rather disgusting) interior of the house.  The owners had apparently left in a hurry as many of their belongings were still there albeit old and gross. This was fun as it allowed me to explore all of the different possibilities for why they may have left. I came to the conclusion they must have been evicted. But we will never quite know will we?04:30 – The overwhelming sensation has subsided and I am now able to enjoy the full extent of the trip. We decide to leave the house in order to ultimately go to a carnival that was nearby. However during the walk B & C kept insisting they were hungry. I gotta be honest This confused the shit out of me because I never enjoy eating while tripping and they were still peaking. We stop somewhere quickly so A can sell some people some weed and then we keep moving forward in our trek.05:30 – we stopped again and walked into the woods so me and A could go smoke. We end up spending a bit of time here. C is handling the acid marginally better than B. B is laying in the dirt here. He is lost in his own thought occasionally saying small snippets of senseless nonsense. B is not great with psychedelics as a whole though. Me and A finish a bowl then we hang out for a bit to wait for B to gather himself. Then we continue onwards. The entire time I was being annoyed with requests to go to McDonalds however A and I knew they would not be good around people so we insisted we went to the park for bit instead.06:30 – We are almost at the park. We left the woods around 20 minutes earlier. As we get to the park another one of our friends (We will call him D) show up. B seems to be alright enough to go to the carnival so we hang out for a bit and chill then we got into D’s car and we continue onward to the carnival. This is where things began to get funny.07:30 – We are at the carnival all still tripping. The ironic part is I had sold a large amount of acid to people in my town. Literally 1 – 5 people were tripping at this carnival. It was fantastic. B insists he isn’t tripping anymore which is obviously wrong as he continues to walk into traffic. The entire time he was doing rather funny things. He would walk up to crowds of people he knew and stand there they would all stop and wait for him to say hi or something and he would reply with “I do not know what to do. I do not know what to say. Goodbye” and just walk away. It was hilarious.9:30 – Fast forward we left the carnival and made our way back to the park. We all smoke a MASSIVE blunt (3 grams or so). After the blunt I am so high I feel like I am peaking again for about 45 minutes. I then returned home and listened to music as I analyzed my entire day and a determined it was a success.So question. I became rather overwhelmed during the peak. I still have a few tabs and plan on tripping again saturday. I was thinking do you guys think it would be a easier come up if I took half a tab waited like 2 hours then took the other half? Or would that just make for a significantly duller trip?If that wouldn't work what can you reccomend to help?","psychedelics","1009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I too have learned that smoking weed while the LSD is still very active can cause unwanted paranoia increase in the chance of thought and visual loops panic confusion etc. The first few times with me were always with weed and the trips were always a bit much coming up or at peak but the times without it were always easier to keep my mind from slipping into an undesired place and thoughts were more ""controllable"".Like I said though I've been reading for some time and I have to say the next time I acquire acid it'll be from BV what I love the most is you offer such a variety of ug per tab. Thing is last year I bought up more hits than I needed calling myself preparing for the worst which would be not being able to buy anymore of the particular blotter that I had become experienced with.

I try not to do acid all the time every 3-6 months or so but when I do I like to have enough to fully get seriously tripping. I find LSD does end up being fairly expensive but this is undoubtedly the best deal going pricewise.

Tried that..and it sort of had a great/bad consequences.Did about 400ug LSD with 40mg of 2cb 2 weeks baseline. But remember I took around 5-6weeks off recently due to how horrible it was all going. Visually I peaked 1 hour in but it still continued for 2 hours after. However the bad part was music it went back to the horrible whiney slowed down ways..unlistenable. I actually sat there for an hour going through all types of songs trying to my best to meditate and figure out if I could block out certain tunes or relax my mind.I was so close to taking a klonopin but didn't cause I wanted to see if there were any ways to figure this out to help others. But I failed    The one cool thing I noticed is when I went ""digging"" into songs trying to find the instruments I couldn't hear I could see my computer screen breaking apart. I was wondering either I have to give up higher dosage since it literally feels like my mind is tired . ( My mind may still need more of a break off). I was also wondering if maybe spacing them out differently would help. I usually take my tabs first then my 2cb 45 minutes later so it all hits at the same time. Maybe thats too much for me right now. I know others have said they someitmes take 2cb 2 hours in a tripmaybe I should try that next.BUT the great thing about not listening to music is that I watched Space Dandy and a video and Tron...and man..Space Dandy....be careful about putting that on if you don't want your trips focused on a heavily sexual trip lol.   Space Dandy Episode 7 the ending of that ..geez... how incredibly emotional... in my room I have lights behind my computer that go with the video and man that scene at the end the way it looked with the golden statue and the sunset before...god damn..OH and hours after I thought the trip was done I go to sleep put on some alan watts.. I was wrong.. I started seeing all these gruesome people trapped in chains and I just went with it all  I wanted to see why they were all entrapped..and then bam... I finally met them..The lizard people.

I had a shitty sleeprelaxingbut shitty.today i feel so incredibly relaxed and could love everyone.Surethe music was horrible but now I know that less is more and maybe to start spreading the dosages.OH sorry lol one last thing  I'm still standing by this but I truly believe meditation helps..my mindstate is no longer confused usually it becomes very hard to figure stuff but not so more.I would say confusion is around 10% strength.","psychedelics","591",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"477",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","I totally agree that marijuana can jeopardize a trip for someone especially if it is their first experience with LSD. The paranioa and thought loops can be overwhelming.However I never drop without weed for precicesly the reason of intensity. When I blaze after I drop the visuals the mindset every element of the trip is amplified.Of course I am extremely frugal whilst tripping","a hit or two will go a very long way.As BV said the best time to smoke is after the peak on the trail end of the trip. I like to spark up right after the peak because I find it keeps the trip going strong and makes it last longer. In that sense weed helps me get the most 'bang for buck'.I've candy flipped a few times and don't really see why people are so crazy about it. Its cool but I find that it really tones down the acid trip rather than amplifies it. Since you're totally calm and anxiety free the radical emotions that LSD gives you aren't experienced. Moreover I find the stimulating nature of MDMA overwhelms the thought processes that I love having brought on by LSD.The last time I candy flipped I dosed 400mcg then an two hours later a point and a half (which is my typical MDMA dosage). Would anyone reccomend a different timing of consumption so as to facilitate an amplification of the LSD effects? That is to say so that I will have a stronger trip experience as is provided to me from marijuana.","psychedelics",257,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"478",NA,"retirement announcement*~sunwu feedback thread~~ lsd specific review","Hello SunWu FansWell Well Well yesterday I finally tried Sun Wu's 150ug LSD blotters.  Since it was my first time trying SunWu's blotters I did not want to take to much as I know you can not take it back.  I know I probably babbled a bit during my report below but I honestly feel that giving as much detail as I can give will do everyone justice as SunWu has some very serious LSD product here and his team deserves the credit and their product is simply amazing.  We need to have more great vendors like SunWu.LSD Experience: I am very experienced with using LSD.  I have tripped well over 100 times in my life ... I lost track after 100.  Of course most of this was back in 1990's  but none the less I have had my share of good LSD.Dose: 1.5 tabs (approx 225ug)Trip Report: 1:00pm - I dropped 1.5 tabs in the afternoon as I did not want to be up ""ALL"" night.  I honestly had no idea how it was going to feel as some LSD seems to give me a very high Mind Fuck trip and other LSD seems to give me beautiful visuals.  Both are pleasant but honestly I wanted to get crazy visuals as this is what I really like about LSD.2:00 pm - I was coming up very nicely.  I starting to feel a warmth in my body and things seem to be a lot funnier than they really are.  I could also start to see some vivid patterns on the kitchen tiles and on my rug which is full of patterns.  At this time I thought it would be good to walk around the block to get some fresh air.  It was raining a little but decided to go anyway.  As I was walking I could notice all these things which I have never noticed before and it was at this time when I really noticed the LSD is kicking in very nicely.3:00 - I was definitely peeking at this time and I said to myself OMG this is the LSD that I remember and have always loved.  The visuals were amazing and the patterns and waves were showing up everywhere.  I did not have to concentrate on them as they were just there.I then went upstairs to take a shower as I was getting a bit warm and thought I would like to shower which I also love doing on MDMA.   I stared in the mirror for what seemed to be like 10 mins but was probably only 2 mins as I was fascinated by the details on my face which were swaying  back and forth.  In my bathroom I have a bath mat and it has long thick fibers coming out of it and when I looked down it looked like worms moving all over the place (you know the amazing feeling like things are crawling when you are on LSD) I had to bend over to touch it as I was just so fascinated by it.  The shower experience on LSD was amazing I close my eyes and I saw rainbows and color patterns which I cannot even describe except it felt like I was looking though a kaleidoscope.5:00pm - Decided to eat some leftovers and watch some comedy TV since I could not pay attention to anything that required a crazy plot due to all the little distractions around me.  I kept laughing at the people on TV and the TV kept pixelating which made me laugh harder.  The show I was watching is a funny show but on this LSD things were insanely funny.8:00pm - At about this time the visuals were starting to die down and become less noticeable.  I decided to eat some marry jane treats made from cannabutter which I prepared the night before as I know it would help me relax and sleep after my adventure.  I know people say smoking weed during the trip is great but I don't like it when I am peeking as I think it degrades my trip.  At least for me it does.  This is why I waited until later when things were coming down.10:30pm - Went upstairs to liedown and watch some TV and think about my day and how great this LSD felt.  I had no problem falling asleep by 11:00 pm.  I was surprised but in a happy way since I had an amazing trip.I woke up this morning feeling 100% and with a nice afterglow.  I feel alive and amazed at how clean this LSD felt.Overall Rating: SunWu this was the best experience on LSD that I have ever had and it was only 1.5 tabs.   Most of my days of experimenting with LSD was in my teenager days and back then I was young and did not appreciate things like I do now that I am older.  Another amazing thing about SunWu's LSD was there was absolutely NO BODY LOAD.  I felt very energetic  for the entire trip.  Amazing.Would I purchase again: SunWu you will be seeing an order request from me within the next few weeks.  Your LSD is the bomb.I have tried a few other vendors LSDs (who are well known for their LSD) which I won't mention who  and the one thing I noticed time and time again is that some LSD gives me a more intense mind fuck and other LSD gives me super visual experience.  Personally I love LSD for the visuals and probably why I love SunWu's LSD.  I tried to search the clearnet forums to see why some LSD does this but did not really find an answer.Anyway if anyone is considering SunWu's LSD 150 ug blotters I would say do not hesitate if you love beautiful visuals with very little body load then you will love this LSD.Thank you SunWu and your Team for giving me this experience that I hope to do time and time again (with moderation of course  ). ","psychedelics","1002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"479",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Thanks for the replies everyone. Blue yeah your right about what you were saying. I actually end up remembering alot now in my trips and that is sort of the downside in some ways. I could write them all outbut I would probably botch it up pretty bad. But I still understand just about everything I remembered from this past trip. Perhaps I'm trying to go at it way too fast and it just needs a slow buildup. I think coming back to being sober the idea of doing everything asap happens cause when these types of trips happens it always comes back into the "" dood your going to die lifes short and guess what shithead you've wasted a fuckload of it. You need to make shit happen and you need to make it happen asap. Then it goes into all the helpetc. And in the trip it feels like it gives you such a positive boost thinking that when your out of the trip its going to be so easy to apply it all. In a way it's giving you an extremely positive mindset on how I believe succesful people look at living life. All the worries anxietydepressiondistractions are all gone. It's so empowering emotional and gratifying. Then when it's all over you come back into real life and damn..putting it all into practice is extremely difficult cause my brain is filled with the failures I've had doubts worries anxietyetc. I remember one point during the trip I summed up LSD somewhat as ""The tab to making idiots think they are smart"" . Even though I don't believe that maybe it was an observation since whenever I try to talk to friends about any of this the replies are usually met with nothing. No talkdebate etc. That's why forums like this are awesome it's really the only place I could come to talk to about anything I've experienced. Everywhere else just seems like an odd world where no matter how many familyfriends work I'm around it just all seems like places I never fit into. Lastly like Blue said the one thing I love about psychedelics is after trips I have no idea what I will learn see experience . It's all a mystery of what may happen and that is sooo coool . Some people take years to change themselves and sometimes before a trip I have no idea how much I'll change just the day after..How cool is that..","psychedelics","413",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"480",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Have any of you read about the Eleusinian Mysteries?

This could be accounted for by the fact that an hallucinogenic drug came into use; this as already mentioned is something that religious scholars believe.    The characteristic property of hallucinogens to suspend the boundaries between the experiencing self and the outer world in an ecstatic emotional experience makes it possible with their help and after suitable internal and external preparation as it was accomplished in a perfect way at Eleusis to evoke a mystical experience according to plan so to speak.    Meditation is a preparation for the same goal that was aspired to and was attained in the Eleusinian Mysteries. Accordingly it seems feasible that in the future with the help of LSD the mystical vision crowning meditation could be made accessible to an increasing number of practitioners of meditation    I see the true importance of LSD in the possibitity ofproviding material aid to meditation aimed at the mystical experience of a deeper comprehensive reality.

The US bulk buyers have another option for MDMA but this time it's Canadian which for a lot of people is perceived as safer than purchasing from EuropeThat being said your prices better be extremely competitive (~$13-25/g for 50g+) otherwise the heavy hitters won't waste their time. It seems obvious at least to me that GFN is very close to the source (chemist). There would be no other reason why his prices could be so cheap and the only rivals he has in sales are those selling in places like NL/BE where MDMA is found everywhere due to the legal leniency.Any other thoughts would be appreciated I think we could all benefit from this.","psychedelics","189",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I would imagine if audio could melt that is the sound I am talking about. Usually even the visuals will do the typical 3 layers rotate and melt. Clouds end up looking more skeleton like and it becomes a boring trip.My last trip was a mix of this..thinking was awesomevisuals were cool but the audio was just fuuckkkkeeeedddd. Another example of this was when I decided to watch Tron I could not understand one word of what was being said it was like my mind was like..fuck this..it requires too much right now..just focus on thinking since thats all the power we have left.I tried meditating good music etc. Even while meditating I tried to focus on the music so hard instrument by instrument and it felt like I was going deeper and deeper to the point when I looked at my computer the screen seemed like it was about to shatter...Either way I'm on the ""more is less"" now with psychedelics and may just space them apart rather than timing them to hit all at once with each other.

It's the only real way to be sure of the purity and strength of the product you're buying. Even then a single lab test on a single batch is not going to prove much. The tester could be shill the lab could make a mistake the sample could be contaminated or spoiled etc. etc.It takes lots of anonymous testing by different people to show a trend and that's where we need to get to. In Europe Energy Control is the only real option and it costs 50 Euros for each test. It's fantastic if Giancarlo is going to get some tabs tested as I believe he can be trusted.

"487",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","I would be interested on this ""dosing/underdosing"" situation. Anyway! Just an update on a new occurrence with my interactions with Tess. First off. I ordered in bulk for the Sale that went down a month or so ago. I had ordered near the end of the Sale so when I got my product I was missing my extra 20%. I messaged Tess and without any hesitation I was sent the remainder of my order free of charge. What a way to keep a customer around!!!! I Have to say I never thought doing drug deals on the darknet is where I would find some of the most upstanding businesspeople around haha. ALSO in regards to the strength. I have ""been Tessellated"" to varying degrees about 10-12 times in the past year ish. And I considered myself somewhat experienced due to lots of research on the product and myself. I took ONE I repeat ONE tab of the ""new stuff for the spring sale"" and I shit you not it was the strongest psychedelic experience I ever had in my entire life. I was very very very very overwhelmed. Almost to the point of having a ""bad trip."" I felt overwhelming moments of sheer eternity some terrifying (in magnitude) and others more angelic than words can faithfully articulate more than I had felt on DMT. And some points where I thought I was literally dying or past death. I have never had a dissolution of my ego as I did when I took that one trip off ONE tab. My pillars of personal philosophy and notions of reality literally crumbled all around my soul and it was arguably the most transforming mental experience I have ever bestowed upon myself. OKAY so there is that. I would still like to hear about this dosing situation. I've only gotten ONE shipment from tess where I thought it may have been a bit under dosed but granted it sat out in my car for a while and was at a friends house being subjected to a bitch of an ex girlfriend who probably sat it out in the sunlight just for spite haha.Â ","psychedelics","359",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Took 1 AL-LAD tab. +1:30 Blues 2cb finally starts kicking in. God damn..music is sounding awesome. I'm loving it. Unlike last time where I thought it was a bit lacking this music was soft extremely detailed and that spacey vibe that I love. It literally has a feel like your on a cloud listening to music.I do think the piracetam is definately helping. It usually makes music sound better sober and I have a feeling its working great with the 2cb. Soon after I noticed I fucked up. That al-lad tab was too much..I wanted to do blues 2cb only but I fucked up and did the newbie thing of thinking it wasn't working it was just delayed to kick in. I know the difference between a 2cb trip visual/audio and when that AL-LAD kicks in bad. Literally in minutes the whole trip just started going to shit. I don't want to get into a long winded report about it all but it was bad. I tried my meditation calming down but like usual like many other things in life I failed. All the music chords start going badrewindyslowing down then the rush of trying to fix it all speeds up everything and causes a rush of anxiety. Blue's 2cb of love was gone. It was the first time I had to use 1.5mg of klonopin to end my trip. The stuff works pretty quick I did .25 at first it helped calm down the anxiety within minutes deadened the visuals quite a bit but it all krept back an hour later to where I decided to take 1.25 mg of klonopin.Â  2-3 minutes later it was all fine and dandy. But sad cause I had a great trip but ruined it all. Next time Blue's 2cb only. His 2cb really is one of love. I really don't know how else to put it. I love the way it makes me feel and the way the audio sounds. Still for me visually it's still not there but maybe it could of been if I didn't do the klonopin due to the bad trip. Side note- I think piracetam can be a great booster I'd love to try it again. I know some of you may remember my trips always being incredibly short..this time even with the klonopin visuals where still kicking 8 hours later. And usually for me 4 hours adn the trip is done! I said last time less is more and I didn't listen to myself and this is what I got. Â  Next review I'll have an honest taste of just blue's 2cb. I'm really guessing 30mg of his 2cb and maybe 1/4 of his LSD tabs would put me in the exact stage I need to be in. BUT I did finally meet the elf people! Boy where they just all gathering around to see me and study me they were quite friendly and curious. I really felt great when I saw them.

Honestly you haven't posted many positive reviews of psychedelics where you had a GREAT time and it was a full-on all-positive experience. Depression can cause this along with other emotional/mental issues - anxiety etc. I don't know you or what you may or may not have but from your posting it sounds a lot like depression talking.It also sounds like you should take a very long break from psychedelics. Start exercising and eating right - this means cut out the junk food sugar carbs. Get in your meats (chicken beef etc) along with tons of fruits and veggies. Start taking supplements - a multi at bare minimum. IF you are taking other psych drugs (anti-depressants anti-anxiety pain meds) you'd need to discontinue their use to achieve the full effect of psychedelics.Then and only then if I were you would I try any psychedelics at that point.

"492",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Man you gotta stay positive. Don't view yourself as ""a loser"". We ALL have things we don't like about ourselves but what you do is you change the things you can to fit your picture of who you want to be.For example I gained a few extra pounds this winter and am working diligently to get them off while lifting - this means I make it a point to just GO TO THE GYM! Consistency in this kind of stuff is important. I know we can't change some things about ourselves but the stuff you CAN change CAN be changed through sheer will power.My father died last year. It has torn me up to an extent I've never thought possible. Even through this though I repeatedly tell myself ""it will get better. i WILL see him again"" and try to remember the happier moments in my life with him.Seriously though exercise eating right and supplementation can make a VERY big difference in how you ""feel"" which will change how you think. Do you exercise and eat right? Not only will exercise/eating right make you feel better your appearance will get better as well as your health which are 2 major bonuses in life.Drugs are tools man you can't view them as an end-all fix-it to life's problems. They sure can help specifically LSD/mushrooms/MDMA/cannabis but in moderation. I've also had times where my smoking (cannabis) has caused me to slip into depressions - so I take 2-3 month breaks here and there to get myself back on track.I wish you the best of luck in feeling better man I've dealt with depression myself my entire life I know the feeling and I also know the feeling of not viewing yourself in a positive light. If you are on anti-depressants by god man get off that shit ASAP. Doctors push that shit because BigPharma pays them very well if they do. Anti-depressants are quick solutions to long term issues that can be resolved by other means.I can't count how many people I've talked to and known who were better off by changing their diet/exercising/meditating/supplementing whereas others assume doctors are god and pills are the answer - I'm not saying you ARE on them but if you are understand they could be contributing to your issues. Wellbutrin made me feel like a suicidal zombie.Lastly - everyone can have bad trips. Everyone doesn't have super awesome enlightening profound spiritual experiences EVERY time they trip - personally i've had a few bad trips in my lifetime but you learn from it.

"495",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","First off thank you everyone!Just as I hoped to help others in the depression thread you guys also have helped me out so I do appreciate that. As many of you have listed I've been on a very good diet over the past year. No soda junk food foods high in sugaretc..Tryptamine also had some great vitamin/food suggestions that I have been doing as well. Exercise is one of those main things as well that I do alot along with meditation. I don't bother with any negative news readingdrama shitty peopleI read alot as well I mean I've done ALOT of things within the past year to change myself big time. My mental state is so far away from what it used to be..Health wise I get blood work every year and for the most part its good but this past year it has been great.Â  OH and fuck anti depressants..Been on them I;ll never ever ever touch those fucking things again ever since being off of them there's been a part of me that's always been missing it def killed alot of love I had for alot of things in life and emphasized failure much more. But that virus of self hate is still lurking in my brain . I know Blue told me to stay off psych's for a while I did that for about 6 weeks and had a very happy trip off of his 2cb. Waited 2 weeks did the lsd/allad/2cb combo and it was a good/bad trip mix. Followed by this past trip which started off wonderful but ended up bad. I've had bad trips before and man some of them were the best things to ever happen to me. But sometimes I just want a trip thats visually/audio pleasingnothing else nothing more just fun. And I can't even have that. I also fell into that trip hoping these would fix problems but I quickly realized like you guys have said they can just be tools but not problem fixes.I'll be totally honest..nice weather is here..this would be my first summer on psychedelics...Ive been waiting such a long time for this..I don't think I can go a year without psychs. I'll most likely go again 1 month without anything. Even though now mentally I am still now in I guess what you would call a certain state of hapiness cause I'm really not beating myself up for the past mistakes or just lying in bed or distractions to forget about depression but theres still something huge missing I believe it to still be a failure in what society deems as a succesful person and not having a ""love"" for a work/job.Â  On top of that even though like I said I am in a somewhat state of happiness when these psychedelics kick in just the right way its such a huge comapassionlovingfun visually stunning and ego changing thing that it's the only time I get to feel this way...it just sucks that just like DMT I may have to give this up as well..feels like another thing like many where I just want to honestly do good but it backfires. Sorry for all the long posts no need to keep clogging up Blues thread I appreciate all of you that have helped  +1 to you all..threads like this just go to show you that Silk Road vendors & members can really be great and helpful people even though we have no idea who the hell we all are talking to","psychedelics","586",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I have tested it right after it was laid and I have tested it just a couple of days ago and it is potent.I will also say that I have taken the same liquid LSD on multiple occasions and has radically different results. LSD is like that the same dose will be amazing one day and not so strong the next. Your body's state and your mind's state will have as much effect on your trip as dosage does.Not having had other drugs recently being free of stress and being well rested is conducive to a strong trip.I will also mention that if you have been doing LSD a lot then you may find it is time for higher dosages. Someone who only does it once or twice a year will be more effected than someone who does it 20 times a year.","psychedelics","161",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I've also done most all psychedelic rcs. What BV is selling is lsd plain and simple.   Headaches aren't uncommon and can be triggered by many things. The liquid is suspended in alcohol so there's prolly a slight bitterness. And I've had plenty of trips that the residual effects lasted 12-14 hrs. But the trip itself lasted 6-8 hrs.   Like bv said your spreading fud around the forums based solely on an opinion.   It would be one thing if you claimed the tabs weren't as strong as  advertised but your claiming something far worse.  part of the reason the site keeps post counts and such is so when ppl are reading posts from someone they can gauge the credibility of the posts by tye post count and karma and stuff.  Fortunately its obbvious to all who read ur posts that u spammed to get out of newbville so u could trash one of the best vendors on this site.   Maybe u should read thru this thread and read all of bvs feedback before continuing to post.  Then u will see how friendly honest professional and knowledgable he is and that you have made a mistake.   But I got a feeling that you already know all this and that's in fact why you are spreading FUD in the first place.","psychedelics","344",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I encrypted my address to him alongside two separate orders from two other vendors (dirtybit and Italian Mafia Brussels always reliable). Both products had longer turn around times than the sheet from BV which usually comes in 4 days or less. Sent a message after seven days asking if it was taking longer than usual. He had no answers on it. After ten days both other packages had shown up no problem. This meant two things: My address had been written correctly and the sheet had not been seized because why would the other packages be let through after not to mention the 5000 bars from my XK order off the road which also arrived in between. I contacted him to explain this situation asking him to make it right as any mess up had not happened on my end. Rather than take responsibility and own up like a man he copped out and insisted that I got my address wrong. OBVIOUSLY NOT THE CASE since the other two packages that were ordered with the same encryption made it no problem you fuckin snake.

I think he's scared that people on the road are getting wise to his thieving bullshit. Excuse my harsh tone but with the DEA FBI and CIA trying to see every person ever affiliated with any darknet behind bars one thing I have no tolerance for is a spineless scammer sucking the blood of his own kind.

"513",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","I seriously doubt it will show up at this point but If it does I'll update any comments I've made admit I was an ass and never bother you again. And if you'll simply look a few reviews below mine on your page someone said they had an order not arrive and also no cutsoms letter. There's a couple more dissatisfied customers in between mine and that. Maybe I was a little harsh and no I DON'T THINK you should offer a 100% reship for anyone claiming to have not received an order. But by the same token many vendors back their products up with at least a 50% reship/refund policy if it's not received. And what's most interesting (to me) is the vendors that do this that I've dealt with I've NEVER had a package lost from them. When vendors are so confident in the products ability to get where it's going that they back it up at least partially it's always been received no problem. Not saying that's 100% the case across the board but in my experience it has been. For instance I've been ordering from IMB for over a year. HUGE packages of MDMA way pricier than 100 hits of acid. Never had a package go missing but I'm confident that if one ever did they'd send out a new one with little hesitation because they know it means more money in the future even if it's a small loss now. I understand that it's not how it used to be around here but maybe consider that most people on here are trying to do legitimate business same as you. There's more to be gained from a long term reliable relationship plain and simple. For fuck sake I would have even bought another one if you agreed to send two. Also I don't know the criteria of a selective scammer. I would imagine it's something like ""send send send don't send."" And perhaps I did use it loosely but like I said the other packages made it no problem but YOURS is just that unlikely 3 percent huh?? Oh shux. Honestly you think I'm trying to come up 100 hits by extorting you with a bad review?? I think it's pretty clear most of your customer base doesn't give a shit about a few 1/5s. I didn't write what I wrote to be vindictive or to try and hurt your rep. I did it to give an honest account of what my ordering experience was and my take on it. Isn't that the point of a review system??? One last thing. For someone who claims such high order volume and success rate you'd really think you'd have some kind of insurance for no show packages. Still hasn't come and I really don't think it was sent and MAYBE I'm wrong but this is the first no-show no-explanation I've EVER dealt with in my two years in this business.

Suspicious behavior indeed. According to you we should offer 100 tab reships to everyone claiming a no show.Selective scamming makes zero sense for more than one reason. I have unlimited access to product. What do I gain from randomly screwing people over? It seems to me that sending out products that I have to customers would result in repeat business. Am I getting this right? I would gain nothing from selective scamming except a few bucks. On top of all that if you actually had a real conversation with me or took part in the community discussions you'd know that. I am not the type of vendor you claim I am nor have I ever shown a glimpse of being a scammer.

"517",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","So here is a recounting of my first shroom experience in 14 years.  To preface I am a regular user of mdma for many years.  I've sampled LSD a few times microdots for an entire summer and shrooms less than 10x.  So while I'm not a stranger or n00b to psychedelic experiences it's been a long while.  I ordered 10 vials from Trip and received 11 so already I'm in the bonus round!  Communication was excellent I had a couple questions regarding dosage that were answered same day speed was 3 days to the east coast from date of order stealth was unbelievably good.  There is zero way anyone who even opened the pack and looked at it would have any clue it isn't what it appears to be.  I'm a larger guy at about 250lbs.  My SO is about 125.  I poured a full vial (equal to 2g of shrooms) into a small cup of lemonade.  I meant to pour a half vial but ended up more like 2/3 into another cup for my SO.  Down the hatch happy trails!T15 We start smiling.  Wow this stuff is legit I can already tell that.  It hits QUICK and it's like going up the hill on a roller coaster.  You know that first hill is coming.  The butterflies in the stomach started a mild nausea but nothing too much.T30 Whoa.  Corners of the basement are starting to morph and bend a little.  Colors in my periphery are shifting blending from mild reds and blues and greens.  When I shift my eyes to look directly at something it bends and almost...breathes...in and out.  Permagrin for both of us. SO is a littel anxious as her last mushroom trip we did with tea was WAY intense and challenging.  We almost feel dizzy and drunk probably from the visuals messing with our balance and our eyes telling us we were tilting but our bodies not actually doing so.We make the bed our ""home base"" and ""safe place""  For me if the world and what I'm seeing gets overwhelming I slowly eliminate and compartmentalize things until it's manageable.  SO was having a challenging time doing that.  She is on 2/3 of a dose but half my weight mind you.T60 OK we're starting down the first hill and picking up speed fast.  We get the giggles and are immediately overcome with an urge to have sex.  As someone who's had sex many many times on many many substances sex on this stuff was quite literally out of this world.  Like...both our minds took off and we were traveling through the universe.  I think that the number of orgasms my SO essentially was like dropping a tactical nuke in her brain.T1h45m Pekaing hard not sure if the sex we just had was a catalyst for the crazy things I was seeing but my SO at this point is staring in wonderment at our ceiling and sees the universe plain as day open up to her on our ceiling.  I wish I saw what she saw because the smile on her face and her seeing the other 90% of the world we normally just tune out was amazing.  In her words ""I'm on a spaceship right now and I'm flying through the universe don't you see it??""  I didn't I was getting alot of CEVs and plenty of OEVs but not near to that extent.  SO has a a seizure disorder so I think psychedlics affect her brain a little differently and much stronger than people without the crossed wires she has.  We melt into the bed and each other just laying there letting the Armin van Buuren ASOT 650 from Utrecht take us on a journey.  I guide my SO through the challenging part helping her to see she can control what she wants to some extent and how to block out things she doesn't.T2h30m We venture outside (it's evening time now sunset) the pink sky with clouds is flashing like a kaleidoscope.  We see little specks of light like fireworks just dancing all over the place.  Trees are vibrant grass looks like carpet.  I'm loving it but my SO got a little overwhelmed with sensory overload. after a bit.  Again she's ona much more intense journey than I am at this point.  Physiology chemistry and body weight I think are factors here.  We retreat back inside until the sun goes down.T3h30m I wanted her to go inward a bit explain I will be right outside and left her at home base on the bed.  I venture outside by myself and just stare up.  Funny never noticed all these stars before.  Sonofabitch they're dancing around and waving at me!  A plane flies overhead.  That was surreal.  I instantly transported to above the plane and was watching it from above as it ventured west.  This was the most intense part of the trip as far as visuals.  After about 30 mins I remember where the fuck I am and....holy shit I left my SO inside by herself having an intense experience....better get back in there.  Go back inside and she's laying on the bed flat on her back having an orgasm.  I shit you not she was fully clothed laying there having a full body orgasm.  I had read that could happen to some girls but to see her in ecstasy just LAYING there...man this stuff is for real.  YMMV but this actually happened to her.  Soooooo yeah we have sex again.  Mind blowing. So says in all the years of rolling the sex we just had blew that away.  And when we have sex on mdma it's usually incredible.  T4h30m things get a little blurry. We're melted into each other the bed just listening to whatever trance music is playing.  Both our eyes are closed and we don't say anything just let it take us where it will both travelers in our own minds.  I share what I'm seeing and she sees the same thing and vice versa.T5h We are gently coming down.  We decide to head upstairs still coasting along and lay down.T6h both of us drift off to sleep.  7 hours later we make up.  ZERO hangover.  Still some mild residuals as far as seeing things just little flashes in the corner of our eyes.  In review an epic experience.  I probably need 1.5 vials my SO maybe needed 1/3 to start.  Highly highly recommend.  An experienced user could probably easily go with 2 vials to start for a hell of a ride.  Trip has got something great here.  Highly recommend.  I can only imagine what combining MDMA with this would be like.  Almost TOO intense maybe but at lower doses to start could be really really interesting.  Will definitley be doing this again.","psychedelics","1129",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

And it was perfect.Â  I was in the backyard as I took a vial and a fourth with some blueberry juice. At the very beginning the first 10-15 minutes I was doubtful that anything was happening-- but I knew to be patient. After about 30 minutes my body all of a sudden felt like mashed potatoes and so I sat down. This was a great feeling like a body high from weed. About 10 minutes later I saw a squirrel fall out of one of my trees and I just lost it. I started laughing hysterically and commenting things like ""stupid squirrel""! From that point onward there was no doubt it taking effect. I started appreciated nature in ways that I've neglected. Everything felt right in that backyard. Then the most badass thing happened-- It started to rain pretty heavily. I just stayed outside for the next 30 minutes under a canopy admiring that shit. The Earth soaking up the rain the grass and leaves from the trees moving to the wind. The roof dripping with rain. It was amazing and I loved it.About an hour later a really good friend came over and I convinced him to try it (for the first time with me) so he took the remaining 3/4 vial. We were playing Elder Scrolls Online while listening to Ziggy Marley. Since the settings were turned to max and on a 30"" monitor I was already enjoying the hell out of it. About 30 minutes later he did something really stupid in the game and died and lost his shit then. From that point onward we were creeping around in the World PVP while listening to Ziggy just tripping out at the landscapes and entirety of it all. A little bit after it started raining again and we decided to walk to another friend's house down the street. He wasn't home but we regretted nothing. Everything was in like HD as if reality got an update.After another hour or so we started climbing down and summed up that it was an overall pleasant experience we would like to have again sometime soon. No ill effects or hangovers or anything like that! Great trip! I want to do a bit more next time!Â ","psychedelics","389",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

About an hour before sunset I headed back towards my drop in spot.  This is when things went a bit crazy.  I was making my way through a marshy area about 25-30 feet wide from one side to the other. When I notice something a short ways in front of me start moving away fron the bank to the middle of the canal and stay there..  Took me a few secinds to realize that I wasn't tripping and what I was seeing was real. I stopped paddling but still coasted a bit when I realized the damn thing I was looking at was a fcking alligator head!! I'd say 2ft from eyeball to snout.   But because I hadn't heard of any alligators being in this body of water for at least a decade I started doubting myself. Then the things dissapears under the water just like ive seen a dozen times on tv and then i started panicking. I didn't want to paddle over the area but there wasn't another way to get back. Amd since I was then really uncomfortable being on the water in my state of mind knowing there could be plenty more in the area I decide I must pass over it and get back asap.so. I paddle my fastest over the area until I felt I was a safe distance from it. I stop paddling to ctch my breath and call my buddy and tell him what happend when something came up underneath my kayak and bumped it hard enuf to make me drop my phone as I was dialing.  Now this freaked me the fck out. I took off out of there and didn't stop paddling until I made it back to my campsite. The whole rest of the way I was hearing splashes and limbs cracking.  Would have been bad enuf sober but bc I was tripping my audio and vision was off and my mind was convincing me I was hearing alligators coming off the banks into the water to try and knock me off my kayak. . It was nuts!!  So i got back and stayed in my tent until the trip subsided  and then headd home.  Next time I think ii will do a bit of research on the local wildlife before I decide to wander into the wilderness frying balls!","psychedelics","475",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"520",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","I recently ordered BV's 3 strip of the 150ug House Blotter. Placed an order on a Wednesday and recieved on Saturday. The tabs came in fantastic stealth/packaging unlike anything matched on the road that I have recieved previously. Being it Saturday and having the house to myself I decided to drop all 3 into the rabbit's hole. It had been exactly a week since I dropped 2 of Pimpit's WOWs and I had a rather strange reaction to them. Im not sure if they got degraded in the packaging or what but the trips were weak. Now back to the drop. After I retrieved the acid I quickly put it under my tongue and pressed the tabs forward onto my lower gums. The blotter paper had a samuari on it so I knew I was about to take a journey. This was around 12:00pm and it was pretty sunny out. I decided to sit by my pool and wait for the trip to kick in. And boy did it kick in. In less than 30 minutes I knew the LSD was about to rewire my brain. As I felt the come up I decided to smoke some ganja to ease any nausea and anxiety I may find myself in. I did have some nausea but is to be expected when your body makes such a drastic change into another conciousness. By an hour in I was well into my trip. Crazy lovely organic visuals painted across my backyard. Trees and flowers seemed to glow and oscilate in harmony. I found myself in thoughts of peace and positive vibes as the intense euphoria over came my body. I was in pure awe at the landscape my backyard had turned into. No movie ticket could replace the fantastic shapes and colors of the clouds plants rocks in my backyard. I spent most of my trip outside and my last visuals I can remember were the clouds turning into vast geometric patterns in the sunset. unreal. Also during my trip I blasted reggae/trap music while taking a shower and Ill be damned if my whole bathroom wasnt a rave. Changing colors and swaying to the music. I would look at my phone or my laptop and the words would glow and change color and move around while magically keeping the sentence i was reading intack. I absolutely loved my trip. I had many thoughts of the 60s and envisioned myself as a hippie taking LSD in cali in the 1960s. This shit was fucking fantastic man. Life changing. Spirit moving. BV thank you for this!

I had only tried dry shrooms in the past.  Im glad I only took the one as it was the perfect amount to take.  I have taken shrooms dozen of times but the last time has been almost a year ago and the only recent psychadelic i took was san pedro a couple months ago.  I want to say that however Trip grows and prepares the cambobian/golden teacher its the fucking best.  SO many answers revieled and so many more questions.  It  alowed me to play guitar and move for like 3 hours.   ALL about the good vibes and good music. Rebelution and MOD SUN. Jack Frost weed goes super good with this batch. Just like the vendor said becauase its liquid it hits your stomach first hard and quick.  That was the only bad part of the trip/product is that i just wanst used to the stomach/body high from hour 1-2ish  but after that it that plane of pure ausomness.  Took at 2:40 and lasted all the way to afterglow which started about 7:30 and then slightly feeling it from then to about 10 but by that time i was just mostly stoned from the weed.  I had worked out in the morning and had some food but kept it light.  Tried eating a powerbar part way through cuz i new I needed something but that was hard.  Just so much good enery and ideas that why i guees their called golden teacher mushrooms. Good ramp up in strenght over time.  I like the vendors description of cruse controll felt like it was increasing 10mph each hour till i hit the sweet spot and just ride the wave. I tried growing my own cambodians and golden teachers last year but my batch was no where near as good.  Thank you TripwSci and to all those out there support this great vendor.  I appreciate the extra labor he put into the product.  I highly recommend watching www.podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/aubrey-marcus-4  I had it on repeate and watched it 3 times durring the trip.

"524",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Preface – I am a teenage male.  I have used LSD several times MDMA many times 25I-NBOMe once cannabis several times salvia once and mushrooms once before.  This is my first experience with pure psilocybin.I drank approximately three quarters of one vial alone in my room at 11:15 in the morning.  For about 45 minutes I listened to music waiting for the effects to kick in.  The first thing I noticed was the auditory distortion.  It was like I was hearing everything for the first time.  The traffic by my house the heater the wind through the trees even the noises my stomach made.  Then at around noon I began to notice the visuals.  Bright color patterns seemed to be coming through the windows and covering the walls and ceiling.  My sense of time began to become very disoriented understandably.  By around noon the trip had reached it’s peak and the visuals were becoming a little overwhelming.  On my ceiling I could see a creature coming out of a cocoon of light a creature I interpreted to be some kind of goddess.  Her face seemed to fill my entire field of vision and her eyes seemed to stare directly into mine.  I remember feeling some anxiety at this point but I forced myself to close my eyes and push my arms out to repel negative energy.  That was the peak of the trip.  Once I began to come down slightly I looked around my room and everything seemed to be covered with some form of ancient writing almost like cave paintings.  Even my arms and legs were covered in the strange text as if it was a message I couldn’t interpret.  I remember having a similar hallucination during one of my LSD experiences.  Possibly a wink to McKenna and the stoned ape theory.  As I began to come down around 12:30 I ate some bread and drank some juice which increased the speed of my comedown.  At this point the visuals vanished as quickly as they had arrived and I was left with an interesting mental high.  I began to reexamine my life—relationships drug use parents friends everything.  I began to speak aloud to myself as this was the only way I could seem to make sense of what was running through my mind.  At around 1:30 my trip was over.  After effects included absence of thought slight bodily numbness hunger stoned-like behavior and fatigue.Conclusion – Not a glowing experience not a horrible experience.  I have had both and this fell somewhere in the middle.  My anxiety seemed to prevent any real progression of the trip and although the potential of a bad trip was there it did not take place.  Far more visual then any other psychedelic I have used.  I plan on using liquid psilocybin again although I would prefer it be in company of trusted sober friends as I find that greatly decreases anxiety.  I was surprised at the potency of the substance.  I did not expect to trip as hard as I did off three quarters of the vial.  My advice to those unfamiliar with mushrooms—start small with this stuff.  If you don’t know your tolerance try a half a vial maximum.  If you didn’t get enough you can always redose later but you can never undose.  Stay safe and know your limits before you test them.  God knows I’ve had to learn that the hard way.Thank you Trip for the opportunity to experience pure psilocybin.   ","psychedelics","581",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"525",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","After reading the advantages to condensed Psilocybin over eating the actual mushrooms I was extremely interested since I find the texture and pumpkin seed flavor to be repulsive. As a result I decided to order this amazing product. Shipping took about 3 days and I was very pleased with the stealth. This was my fifth time taking mushrooms and it was without a doubt the most profound trip I have had to date. I emptied two and a half vials (about 5 grams according to Trip) into a small glass of orange juice and the mushroom flavor was virtually undetectable. However a small trace of an alcohol-like taste was present but not overpowering. A couple of my buddies joined me in this ritual but took slightly less than I did about one and a half-two vials each(3-4 grams). I had eaten a decently sized meal before hand and a very powerful body high was present after about 10 minutes. Thirty minutes after ingestion the visuals began bricks were moving and grass was growing. All of us kept chanting ""I'm so fucking high"" we were bricked (something we all decided to start saying instead since we were outside of our house and didn't want our neighbors to freak). Colors were extremely vibrant and when I looked out across our property I achieved the cartoon effect that lasted for several hours. After about an hour and fifteen minutes we retired to the garage where all our nasty habits take place. All my buddies started ripping a water pipe while I sat there staring off. I would compare the next fifteen minutes or so to a moderate DMT trip that isn't incapacitating I was seeing thin colorful lines in the air that took several different shapes. My ears even got the weird ringing that you get right after taking a hit of the stuff although that only lasted a few seconds. We all toggled back and forth between the garage and outside for the next fourish hours with intense visuals and conversation. The laughing rarely stopped and we covered every topic one can think of. For some reason mushrooms open a new way of thinking and speaking. The body high with mild visuals hung around for a couple more hours until it completely faded away after about six hours. My stomach never hurt and I had no symptoms of illness of any kind. I woke up the morning after fresh as a daisy no back pain or headache either.TLDR-This stuff is amazing very potent but would recommend taking more than one vial if you really wanna trip hard like I did.

We had no grasp of what time was and we thought we were doing so much shit but really we were just sitting around on bean bags couches running around and just making the best of our trip. Most of us felt this sensation every once in a while of a ""sonic boom."" During this sonic boom our ears would ring a little bit and everything you saw would just melt.  It was amazing. At one point I was watching Adventure Time on the TV and the whole TV melted into the entire wall of the basement and I was astounded. My friend's and I all had an amazing first trip and definately will buy from Trip in the future.  Your the fucking man Trip!","psychedelics","271",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I recieved both orders within days he answered all my questions the stealth was unreal just like the shipping times and the FUCKING LIQUID MUSHROOMS ARE BEAUTIFUL.

Put on the movie training day and just sat back and enjoyed that shit. Also i couldnt stop laughing for some reason when the three vatos in traing day are telling the white cop that theyve had there shit pushed in lmao.Also when he calls Alonzo a ruthless VATO I almost passed out from laughing so much. Trip is doing on silk road what every vendor should great communication great stealth fast delivery and an excellent product. Couldnt ask for more perfect vendor and even better product. Order from trip and just have a great experiance and open your mind. Get together with some good friends drink a vial and just fucking enjoy.

Trip is VERY professional with replying to questions/concerns and I would say is probably one of the best vendors on the road.Package arrived in 2 days! 2 days! Does Trip deliver the product by hand? I've never had anything show up so promptly I was very pleased by this.Stealth is as good as it can get. I can safely say that if the package was opened no one would know the better. Even if the product was smashed to bits none of the liquid would escape.How are the shroomies? Oh boy -- went out to the lake for some fishing and dropped a vial. Within 15 minutes I could feel the come up (no anxiety!) and within 30 minutes I was fully embraced by the mushroom kingdom. Absolutely NO anxiety or negative feelings with this stuff. I am very impressed as mushrooms always give me a couple of minutes of come up anxiety and a few bad 'waves' every time I trip on them. But with these it's just a very clean no worries trip full of euphoria and happiness. Maybe it's because the mushrooms are in a liquid form? All in all Trip has a customer for life right here.

Fortunately every order other than that 1 the tabs have been extremely potent and on point.We do not have enough reports coming in from people who ARE purchasing from Tess (LSD or MDMA) where we can gauge what's really going on behind the scenes at any given moment. Simple as that. Lab testing was questioned at some point but I think people were satisfied in general.Without much going on hard to say. A lot of people seemed to have some order issues (including myself) ranging from delivery to potency but there are a lot of people who will vouch Tess's product is legit and on point most of the time. Some have never had 1 problem.

"530",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","So this was my first time trying psychedelics. I heard they were less of a high and more of a deep spiritual experience unlike many other things. I thought it would be cool to try but being my first time I was kind of nervous and wanted to make sure everything went smoothly. TWS definitely made me feel safe and sure of what I was getting","and let me tell you it wasn't dissapointing. Me and a friend both drank one vial and within 20 minutes we both started to get a very warm feeling. Soon after I was uncontrollably laughing for no reason and I don't even know how long this went on. It seemed like time had stopped. I had closed eye visuals of color changing trippy patterns and got full body sensations while drinking some arizona strawberry kiwi tea (which I highly recomend). Apparently I described it as the water of the Garden of Eden. We listened to music and I closed my eyes and just enjoyed being in the moment. After a while my friend thought it would be funny to invite some of my other friends over to see us while we were on it. It was not a good experience. I started to feel as though i was a zoo animal and was seeing very vage bars around my body. It made me extremely self concious. I would recomend having one or two close friends only because I was saying things that no one understood even though they made sense but in a very different way. You need to have somone that won't judge what your saying but guide you. After this i left the room kind of angry and layed down on the ground in another room with my friend that had taken it with me. He was also saying and doing things without really making much sense. But he sat down and started playing guitar while i just layed there and I had some very deep visuals and thoughts on what was going on in my life. At this point it felt like it had been days. I had no conception of time at all whatsoever and i still can't believe all of this only happened in such a short time. It had the very strong effects for around 2 hours and then after that it started to become less and less overpowering until i could function like a normal human being again around the 4 hour mark. It was a little bit shorter than I expected and I wish I could remember more specific things but it was no doubt worth the money and I am going to try to be more mindful during my trip next time in order to remember things better.

"531",NA,"25x-nbome / lsd / acid questions and reports ! ##","I eat a lot of NBOMe 25i/c and have had a fair bit of LSD also and I don't understand why so many users are so opposed to NBOMe they are a great drug and I have learnt just as much about myself from a 25i trip as I have from LSD. The only problem that I find with NBOMe is I get awful comeups particularly from 25c. Everytime I throw up haha. My all time favourite trip was combining 1200ug of NBOMe 25i with 200ug of LSD they worked very well together and I got the most amazing CEV and geometrical patterns.My first trip was with 25i and I don't regret it. I would recommend trying anything as long as you go into the experience with an open mindset and allso remember that if anything goes wrong during the trip it's all because of the drug and it does stop eventually. If you're after a trip with some mindfuckery go with LSD or 25i if you just want some visuals short trip and no mind games try 25c.Always keep in mind that with NBOMe that they are a lethal drug and don't do too much.Another pro of LSD is that it has a shorter tolerance period meaning more frequent trips without having to increase dosage.Oh and after you have taken your first trip if you decide to trip again weed really adds to the experience and so does laughing gas! hahaÂ ","psychedelics","242",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"532",NA,"25x-nbome / lsd / acid questions and reports ! ##","Well I started dabbling in psuchedelics with 25i. While it was quite fun with a clear headspace (did up to 2mg) it can really screw you up physically.First of all the comeup is bad. Loads and loads of body tension and you have to keep the very bitter tab under your tongue for 30 minutes without swallowing too much of your saliva. Even when the drug has taken effect you would still feel weird pains in your body as it is a very powerful vaso-constrictor. Also it gave me head aches the following day. But not the usual ones... Just a nagging pain in the back of my head. This has all been confirmed by the people I was doing it with so it's not an isolated phenomenon. On the bright side I had loads of fun on 25i and I tended to have clear thoughts and was able to focus on different things while on it (was even able to drive... DO NOT DO THIS ON ANY DRUG BTW!). LSD is a very different animal. The comeup is nice and smooth even with the cheapest acid I bought. No weird pains just a tiny bit of body tension and some stomach cramps during the come up. Once the acid takes charge though...prepare to be amazed. Words get different meanings music becomes something else etc. Even the visuals are much more amazing on LSD imo (25i only gave me haloes around light sources and slight trails around moving objects). The major difference though is that while 25i is quite a ""focused"" drug (I was able to think about anything while on it) LSD takes you wherever it wants and really shows you what your mind is made of. Also and I can't stress this well enough i NEVER got head aches from LSD (4-5 trips) which is quite important personally...","psychedelics","310",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"533",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","OK so today the sun is shining here in the UK and I had a bit of time on my hands so I thought it was only fair to do whatever I could to prove one way or the other whether there is anything out of the ordinary with Tess's 200ug tabs from the recent shipments.So I dropped 2 of the little blighters at 8:40am and it is now 3:40pm and I am just about able to type coherently enough to make some sense here (I think).All I probably need to do is give you a couple of excerpts from the trip report I was trying my best to update every now and then:T +1.5 - ""Fucking amazing. Like millions of orgasms constantly firing off one after the other. Visuals & colours as you'd expect!""Followed a few hours later with:T +4.5 - ""Holy fuck!""I think you'll agree that sums it up very nicely.And to summarize what we have learned today:Tess has the best. Lovely and clean with really strong visuals. It really does make a massive difference with the sun shining and lovely blue skies though.There is nothing weak about the 200ug tabs I have here. Based on today's experience I'd probably try 400ug again just to make sure everything else was the same and then I might up it to 500ug after that but I think 800ug is out of reach for me at the moment.Plenty of time to take it slowly and carefully explore each rung up the ladder...Just today I've seen sights and had feelings that many people will never have the chance to see or feel maybe in their entire lifetimes.Thanks Tess.Â  Â ","psychedelics","277",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"535",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","On June 11 2014 I eased into the psychedelic realm for the first time. I had purchesed a vial of liquid psylocibin from Trip and he was gracious enough to send me a free extra for supporting him. I waited about a week to prepare myself and I wanted to finish school before I took the medicine. Here is what happened.1:30 - I was with my friend who is pretty anti anything related to drugs or alchohol but he is my friend regardless. We were watching some kids play tug of war at a local park and we were just hanging out. I had decided I was going to take the vial with me and dose whenever I felt it was right. My friend walked to say hi to a friend for a minute and I popped back the vial and drank the alchohol tasting liquid. He came back and we decided to walk back to my house.2:00 - We are at my house and we sit on the couch and my friend turns on the TV and the Hobbit is playing. I am starting to feel sort of dizzy and a little bit nauseous mostly from the taste of alcohol which generally is repulsive to me. I felt a little intoxicated but I was also a little bit nervous as to what was about to happen.2:15 - My frined leaves to go to work and I am laying stone still on my couch. That was the first time I actually closed my eyes. I saw some majestic patterns that were so cool and everyone who has ever taken shrooms should be able to relate the the geometric swirly things that you see beneath your eyelids.2:30 - I go up into my room and grab my headphones and hop onto my bed. I had placed like 8 pillows on my bed for maximum chilling comfort. I took my bandanna off of my head and layed it over my face because now I was getting some more vivid visuals. The bandanna was melting into my face and at one point I felt like the entire bandanna was just gone because it was just in my face. I was listeining to some good music too so that amplified everything to a fantastic extent.3:00 - After laying on my bed for a while I wanted to be somewhere totally dark for some reason so I walked into my closet and just sat down in total darkness experiencing some different visuals but just as trippy. At this time I decided I coulndt stay inside any longer because there was too much to explore outside. This is where the real trip began...3:30 - I was walking around my neighborhood with no destincation - totally arbitrary. I live across from a large forrest and I was walking along the road of the edge of these woods. The wind was blowing furiously and I felt so connected to the wind to the point that every time the wind blew I would follow the direction that the wind blew trees and leaves in. The wind took my about a half mile from my house to the highest point in my town. From this point there is a view that splits though a gap on one neighborhood through to a valley and you can see about 2 miles away to a large group of trees. This is difficult to explain but it is the most gorgeous sight and whilst tripping it was euphoric. I decided I was going to walk striaght through the gap of the neighborhood and through the valley and go sit under one of those beautiful trees in the far off distance. I was all alone at this point and I was starting to feel some of the spiritual power of the psylocibin. 3:45 - I hiked through the neighborhood and every now and then I would sit down on the grass and just lay down and close my eyes and trip out for a few minutes. I'm sure I looked like a total hippy with my bandanna on laying in the grass but I was just compelled to do this. I got onto a sidewalk and these 2 girls were approching me from the other direction. They were obviously older than me probably about 21-22 and as they got closer I had this huge smile on my face and they said ""hey"" to me and I replied ""hey girls"" and they started to ask me if I was going to a graduation party but I just kept walking like an idiot (they were going to a graduation party for some kid who just graduated from my high school the day before). I had a mission to comlete and these girls as hot as they were werent going to stop me.4:00 - I make it through the valley and I decided I needed to go home because now I was seriously talking to myself and I was being faced with some serious phsycedelic thoughts. I walked al the way back home again stopping every now and then to just sit down and expereince the visuals.4:15 - I make it home and I grabbed something to drink because I was parched. I went up to my room and right then a massive lightning storm erupted.4:15 - The end of the trip 7:30 - I began to evaluate some thoughts that bubbled up to the surface of my brain. One of the most prevelant things that I scolded myself for was for not working hard enough at the things I love to do such as playing sports and my passion for programming and computers. All sorts of things came up; and I was being so critical of myself I began to feel upset and I wanted it to end. At this point I let go of all of the negative things I had scoled myself for and created a plan to better myself for the rest of my life. I will say this though: when you read in forums and such about people saying that shrooms will bring out your deepest and darkest problems and make you look them dead in the eye they are beyond correct.Â  Taking that small vial of concentrated Psylocibin was one of the better decisions I've made in my life and I will continute to explore my inner self for as long as I live. I want to thank TripWithScience for creating such a safe and helpful service for people like me who have a desire for advneture and exploration of slef and world.

Yes thrush.I stupidly had planned out a party with my 2 friends (after the initial infection cleared) to trip/roll and i started taking my meds while tripping (which are chalky lozenges) - oh my god thrush on LSD is....i don't even know how to explain the horror...The trip went OK though. I had to eventually put the nastiness in my mouth outside of my mind. I put on DREDD on the big screen and focused on that and the trip smoothed out.

Read on.My first order was before Haizenberg offered only Needlepoint tabs so when I ordered 5 110ug tabs they ended up being very weak. I took two at first and after waiting an hour and a half only felt a medium buzz with no visuals. I took the other three tabs and had a great experience but I should have tripped that hard off of one or two tabs. The tabs had a noticable metallic taste to them but I was told this could just be due to the ink. The stealth was very good I honestly believed that I had either lost the LSD or I had gotten the wrong package or something had gone wrong because I couldn't find it. His communication is decent. He's rather busy but for most people he tries his best to respond to most messages within a reasonable amount of time. I have heard of him being a selective scammer but I have not experienced this. His shipping times were not bad at all ten days to USA.My second order went much better quality wise","I bought 10 tabs of 220ug Shiva blotters. It is to my understanding that all of Haizenberg's current LSD stock are of Needlepoint quality. Communication shipping and stealth were all the exact same. This time the tabs actually had some kick and no metallic taste. Just one of those blotters was stronger than all 5 of the 110ug blotters taken together. Needless to say I was very happy with my order.Order with confidence. Haizenberg offers top quality LSD at competitive prices.

Very professional.I dropped at 11am with my dad and we were rushing within 30 minutes. About an hour later we decided to drop another for the fun of it.Shit got crazy real fast and the quality of the tabs were certainly showing themselves. I walked up to a white wall in my house looking at the insane patterns and colours spreading all over. It was an amazing site. After a few seconds of staring I actually began to see my own reflection multiple times slowly swirling around where I was looking.I have no idea how it was happening but it was fucking amazing.A few hours went by and I was sitting in the garden with my Dad. I was eating an ice lolly and my dad had a worried look on his face. He went indoors to calm down.He told me the red of the lolly covered my face and made me look like a demon and had to go in. He said he was struggling to deal with the stuff. He has done a lot of drugs in his time but made it clear that he has never been so fucked out of his face as he was on those blotters. I on the other hand fucking loved it. It was chaos and I can handle shit really well. The buzz was real clean and I was tripping till I went to sleep at about 12am. I slept okay but I was still tripping when I woke up and it gently faded away within the first hour of the next day.This is by far the best stuff I have ever had and I will certainly be buying more in the future.Thanks a bunch Felix the quality and price is unbeatable.

After researching the use of psilocybin to treat depression I decided to try small doses(1-2grams or half vile of liquid) during the worst times of depression and have had incredible results. What I've noticed is that over a period of ~6 months of using psilocybin on a weekly basis has melted away nearly all feelings of depressionand I no longer require psilocybin as a medicine...I still use psilocybin for recreation of course.

For each question answered correctly you would get 100mg of 2C-B and since I got 3 correct I was gifted 300mg of the stuff. I had never tried 2C-B and what I read on the internet about it turned me off for a while. Well last night I smoked the last of my DMT and got shut out (no breakthrough) and for some reason decided to try a little. I parachuted 10mg and then a few mintues later another 4mg. At this point in time the 4mg of Xanax I had taken earlier was in full effect and I snorted a final 5mg. Good fucking God does this shit burn more than anything I've ever put up my schnozz. Cocaine MDA MDMA crushed pills none of those even compare. Luckily I had some saline nasal spray on hand and that soothed things quite a bit. So I sat down and started listening to music for a bit and then it hit me. At first the CEVs were like what I see on MDA (oil slick rainbowish patterns) but quickly things got awesome! The visuals were unlike anything I've ever seen on mushrooms but slightly similar to low level DMT visuals. I had complete control over the hallucinations as well. At one point I said: I want to see beautiful naked women and BOOM there we go morphing into sphinxes and then pouring out of the sphinxes mouth as a naked woman again until the whole thing stretched vertically becoming a strand of DNA. I couldn't possibly explain to you everything I saw because it was all so amazing. At one point and I know this may sound weird I feel that I connected spiritually with Sasha Shulgin and then my dead dog. The visuals were very connected to music as well. The visuals changed and reacted to each song I played. Playing Neil Young seemed to send them into overdrive. After trying this stuff I can without a doubt saw fuck LSD and taking 300ug to get all paranoid and freak out. 19mg of 2C-B gave me one of the top five experiences of my life. Thank you so much BlueViking. I was still tripping this morning when I woke up. Why didn't anyone tell me how amazing 2C-B is before?","psychedelics","406",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"545",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","While I too would love to have Mayan liquid because A) It's amazing and B) It's extremely rare. Due to a few key factors it makes it much too difficult to carry a variety of Mayan. The main reason being it would only appeal to a niche market of connoisseurs that would appreciate it and pay the premium for it. Your average consumer will skip over it because the price will be higher or they've never experienced the Mayan to appreciate it.The second reason is the limited amount of crystal available to work with. This means focusing on one lay at one dosage. If it were any other crystal I'd consider a variety but trust me when I say that the Mayan is not cheap. Economically it would be tough to have a lot of extra liquid on hand. If I were able to get a small amount of the crystal and suspend a limited batch of vials I would certainly do it no question. Wish I could just grab a ""dime bag"" of Mayan crystal and do as I please So for now the 185ug will definitely be a go. If enough people are interested I will look into a lower 100-120ug blotter.Regarding relaunch: It's taking longer than I thought it would. A lot of the work is being done by myself for security purposes. Adding those limited listings backfired on me. Here I thought it would be a trickle of orders but instead we got blasted. That in itself took more time than it should have.Rest assured I'm slaving away day and night to accelarate the process.

Yes I have had great product come in from other vendors on the site and it too was fantastic but there is no comparison between GFN and any other vendor that tries to compete with him. Communication: Every time that I have dealt with him his communication has been spot on lightning fast and he is not afraid to help you out with anything that you have to ask him no matter how small or irrelevant you think it may be.Shipping: Defiantly wont pass the ""if opened test"" however his stealth is good enough that it shouldnt have to be opened by anyone else especially considering he now only ships domestic. That being said not only was the item marked as shipped supper fast but Canada post was on their game and it came in in record time. Purity: These lovely tam crystals had a very pleasant aroma and turned straingt to black using the merck reagent. Small doses will have you rolling for hours and hours. The real reason that this vendor is the king of what he does is because of his prices and the bonuses that are offered as well. I have NEVER found cheaper product Especially when it comes in SUBSTANTIALLY overweight (~20%) whereas other vendors will undercut you even if t is as little as 100mg on a 10g order.

"548",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","I am a big fan of Tessellated LSD. 20+ years taking this stuff and Tess' product is hands down the best I have ever had. Experienced tripsters I have dosed agree. I am working my way through a 50-lot I got off him/her/them some time ago back on SR1 and getting ready to re-up. Everyone here already knows that Tess' stealth and service is top notch.Interesting to read some of the dosage comments on here. I haven't taken more than 2 of Tess' tabs yet. When I take 2 I have a hard time functioning in public. It is a very powerful trip to be sure. I did enjoy that experience and I may try to 2.5 or 3 (500-600mics) at some point but I like 1.5 tab (300mic) trip a lot. This is some potent stuff. Even a half tab is pretty much a full-blown trip. I remember back in the day I would sometimes drop a tab of weaker acid when I felt like having just a bit of a trippy nite and not a full-blown psychedelic event. If you drop even a half tab of Tessellated LSD you're going for a decent ride. My buddy took a quarter tab and said that he tripped pretty hard on that. That said I like to take at least a full tab to get the full experience.I hope to be a loyal customer of Tessellated for a long time to come  Thanks for providing a great product and great service Tess.","psychedelics","252",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"549",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Trip Report:Background: This was my first experience with magic mushrooms. I have tripped twice before on lsd one 140ug dose and one 300ug dose. Setting: I choose Six Flags Great America for my maiden voyage. Most would not recommend an amusement park even for veteran trippers but I feel that I have a strong mind and don't freak out easily. I went with three other friends each of them with no knowledge that I would be tripping. Dose: I had a vial of liquid shrooms with the approximate strength of 2 grams. I mixed them in with a small bottle of Gatorade and there was no taste at all. Experience: I ingested the shroom/ Gatorade mix about 20 minutes before arriving. I had eaten breakfast before we left for six flags so I guessed that it would take about 40 minutes for the effects to start. After walking through the front gate I had butterflies in my stomach and was excited beyond compare. The first thing we did was walk towards X-Flight (A large rollercoaster with many loops). By the time we reached the line I started to notice all the colors looked very vibrant. It was about 11 o clock at this time and the park opened at 10:30 so there was not many people in line. While waiting in line my body started to get a weird sensation flowing through it and the ground felt uneven almost. I made sure to wear mirrored sunglasses throughout the day to not only hide my dilated pupils but also so I could close my eyes and enjoy the CEVs. When the time came to board the coaster I had a huge smile on my face because I could not imagine how much fun I was about to have. As the rollercoaster took off there was a wave of electricity that flowed through my body. The sensation of the wind flying through my hair was amazing and is unlike anything I have felt before. I could not stop myself from laughing as I was experiencing pure bliss. When the ride was finished I was even more excited for the rest of the day than before. The next ride that my friends and I decided to go on was the Giant drop. Once again there was not much of a line. I was about 1.5 hours in at this point and at this point my friend’s faces started to change colors and they took on animal appearances. One of them was a dragon and his dark skin turned a deep purple. All of the background sound from the park including the music and voices started to whirl around me. I could definitely see how some people could get overwhelmed with all the sensory input. When it came time to get on the ride we made sure to get the seats that faced the rest of the park. The slow ride up to 217ft was amazing. I could see the whole park in all of its beauty. When I got to the top I could see for miles the spectacular view. At this point my vision was rippling (there were vertical lines in my vision that were offset. In the middle of enjoying the view the ride dropped without a warning. In the following second I felt one of the most intense feelings in my entire life. It was a mix of absolute pure and utter terror combined with a feeling of complete freedom. When we reached the bottom the only words I could spit out were “HOLY FUCK”. As we were walking to the next ride my friend who was completely unaware still of my current state made the comment: “I wonder what that would be like on acid”. I could not control the laughter that ensued. We arrived at Superman approximately 2 hours since I dosed. The lines were starting to pick up and I knew that we were going to have to wait a while. If something were to go wrong I thought it would be in this line. Eventually we reached a point in line where we were completely surrounded by people because the line was set up to go back and forth. I decided I was going to pull out my headphones and listen to music to enhance the wait. I accidently unzipped my bag too much and everything fell out onto the floor. Everyone turned around and looked at me while I picked up everything from the ground. This was the closest thing to paranoia that I felt the whole trip but I was able to laugh it off and everything returned back to normal. I proceeded to have conversations with my friends that all felt like deep heart to heart talks. I was emotionally connected to everything that we talked about. The superman ride was a great time because it tilts you so that your head is facing forward and your legs are facing backwards like you’re flying. After we got off the ride we decided it was time to eat. Still tripping I was not hungry at all and most of the visuals had worn off by the time they were done eating. I was left the rest of the day with a great mood and enjoyed the rest of my six flags experience even though I wasn’t seeing the trees wave to me . If I could have done it again I would have brought another half vial to redose after around 4 hours but is still had one of the most fun days of my life. I know some people believe psychedelics should be reserved for self-reflection and learning but having fun every once in a while won’t kill ya. =) Big thank you to TripsWithScience for enabling me to have a blast. Not worrying about nausea while getting flipped and spun around everywhere really made my day better.","psychedelics","985",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I spilled a little so i scooped it up with my fingure and found out it taste just like alochol but mixed its tasteless. Did this on a emtpy stomach and man it hit fast in a matter of 5 mins i felt the effects starting to come out and by 10 mins i was in a full trip. My adventure was spent in two areas outside and indoors. First half was outdoors a few hours before sunset enjoying the glorious day in front of me. The first thing that hit me was a spiral inside my body coming out from within my stomach or so it felt like. It flowed outwards untill it consumed my body the best way to describe the feeling i felt was that my soul was like enahnced it felt embodied with positive energy all over. Whenever i would move it felt great so at this point i decided to take my journey to the grass of the backyard. I sat for a few mins then ended up just laying down. Took off my glasses and visuals started hitting me. My first visual was wave effects the grass was like a body of water flowing with the wind and at one point the grass started shinning like it was reflecting the sun's rays. When i hit my peak the grass was surronding me trying to wrap me like a burrito was pretty tight actually. After watching the sun set went indoors and watched a buddy of mine play Metal Gear Solid 5. I haven't play or seen anything about this game but it was the most intense gaming experience i have had. Just watching as Big Boss runs around planting C4 around an army encampment and it felt like I was in the game with Big Boss. I was the pov of the camra right behind him following him around on his mission. Truely mind blowing! By this time its around the 4 hour marker and its starting to fade. I went into the bathroom and stared at the wall. The wall was spinning in a spiral just a normal wall flat light brown wall and it started spinning. Also I've been told not to look at yourself in the mirror while you're on a trip cuz it might mess with your head Idk if thats true but just a heads up incase anyone gets the idea. That was my last visual of the night and its faded from there on lasted a total of 5 hours for me and i had quite a beautiful experience.

"552",NA,"official felixuk review thread - dutch mdma/pills hash and lsd blotters","I finally managed to get round to trying out Felix's MD sample the other day and expected nothing less it is some really fine mandy.Although not yet tested I will write up the beginnings of the review of Felix's MD.Sample MDMA Review (Draft):Stealth: 5/5 - I've ordered off Felix numerous amount of times and even the stealth was good in previous orders the stealth has definitely been improved very professional. I think out of all the orders with Felix (Around 4-5 transactions) only one of them wasn't NDD. One of the most efficient and professional vendors I've had the pleasure to deal with.Communication: 5/5 - Messaged Felix on the forums to be one of those to sample their product and got a reply within the hour and the product was at my doorstep the next day. Can't complain at all.Product: 5/5 - The MD had a lovely aniseed smell to it came in a few small translucent rocks and the rest powder. My friend and I dropped around 140mg + 60mg redose and my roll was comparable to much higher doses that I've experienced from previous rolls. As this was my first roll in a few months I was more than excited. During the come up I did experience some anxiety but around the 50 minute mark we had the ""Oh shit wow!"" moment and my friend I both indulged in euphoria that was taking over and lay on the grass just listening and really enjoying the body high then a few minutes later we decided to whack on some upbeat songs and just really vibed to the music. My last couple of times on MD weren't the greatest it just didn't feel the same didn't experience the need to socialise and was in a bad head space. But this time really allowed for me and my mate to really open up to each other and also call and catch up with a few close friends and who doesn't love that ""Fuck I need to talk to people"" feeling.It's hard for me to try to be as unbiased in a review for MD as the majority of the rolls you experience you do just feel other worldly and it's hard to write anything negative about the drug. But Felix's MDMA in comparison to others I've tried the effects were certainly much 'purer' feeling than others it's without a doubt as soon as I can I will be getting another gram of Felix's MD because at ÂŁ21 a gram to feel the way I did it does make me smile.Cheers Felix awesome product as always man!","psychedelics","435",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"553",NA,"cyanspore - psilocybe cyanescens reviews","thanks for the review. Somebody recently posted feedback on my listing saying 1 gram is too much. I see this sometimes and it's different for different people and other factors apply so 1 gram is still the recommended dose at least for the first time and then you'll know much better what is right for youMore accurately the 1 gram standard is for beginners because 1 gram is almost never enough to scare beginners away. Sometimes it's close as in 'almost too much' but not really enough where a beginner would lose control and never try it again. Of course you can do 10 grams safely physically but mentally it's not a good idea for more than 1 gram for beginners. It's this safety limit that's more important than anything. It has more to do with a comfort level than anything else. We want people to be comfortable with it and not fear itOther than that cyanescens is fairly consistent potency wise. Probably 10% or less variation between different patches. Anyway I've been hunting these for a long time and it comes and it goes with the rainy season. It's always been that way.

"554",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Trip report.I had not planned on tripping last night but sometimes the unplanned trips are the best. Its was a pretty damn good journey. The quality of the product was outstanding. Kicked in fast and the hang over was very tolerable compared to other trips. After 3 hours of sleep I woke up had some water and food and chilled for a bit then went to work 2 hours after that.  By the time I was at work I felt 85% pretty damn good for just finishing a 10 hour shif then trippin balls and going back for another 10 hour shift with only 3 hours of sleep.   Honestly I sometimes feel the same amount of grogginess with out tripping. I think that says a lot about the quality. Also the usual early waves of nausea were absent. A few times I thought I was getting rumbly in the tummy but it passed before I could even identify it. This was a solo trip. I took two vials mixed with pineallpe juice at 130am.  Looked like about half a shot glass topped with juice and shot it back.  It was a good shot but if you are intolerable to alcohol mix it with 4 oz juice and some ice and the alcohol will be unnoticeable.  Next I started rolling some joints. Pretty standard while im waiting for the shit to work.  i only got 3 rolled before that kind of coordination was lost.  Good thing too those j bars came in to play nicely and im glad I didn’t have to roll trippin. Ive never been good at that.  So its only been 10 min and im feeling GOOD. Couldn’t believe it came on that fast. Load up some utube grace slick and hit the playlist button so I get a pretty good 70’s sound track going and videos as well.  30 or 45 min of just relaxing I have a shower. Washed the fuck out of my hair. Towel off and melt into the bed under the fan to dry. Popcorn ceiling kalidascopes but very limited color changes just a little yellowing. The visuals were controllable the entire trip. If I wanted something to swirl and breath and cave in on itself I just had to focus on it.  I didn’t get very many unintentional visuals.Since this trip was unplanned I just rolled with the punches I didn’t have any agenda. I did some soul searching but didn’t really want to work to hard on the inside this time.   Shrooms give me an endurance boost and I usually end up exercising. Biking or blading or raquette ball.   This time it was kung fu practice yoga and abs.  non stop for about an hour in the grass by the pond. Its about 330 am give or take.  Im sweatin my ass off mud and grass on me. i brought an apple with me and that was a very nice thing to have. It was delicious and I made sure I thanked it for being an apple.  Prolly would have worked out more but I though I needed to find a bathroom. Turns out false alarm but im back in the apartment again. Im naked for the rest of the trip. There was lots of rolling on the carpet.   Had a conversation with my reflection for a long time. I turned into a monster several times. The monster wanted out and it kept telling me over and over.   Im a big fat hairy guy so monster turned into gorilla pretty quickly I pounded my chest and monkey jumped around the apartment till I found myself in the kitchen.  Pepperage farm milanos I made love to those fucking cookies. We took our honeymoon in the south of france.Pretty sure after that was just more carpet rolling and ceiling swirls.  Smoked a joint before I hit the floor and praised all things holy that I had rolled ahead of time.  Also patted myself on the back for getting some music on early  it was low  its 5am on a work night so im trying to keep the trip as stealthy as I can. So once im on the floor and I don’t hear cookies crunching in my head I hear the tunes  that was a nice way to come down. Its was a smooth transition. By about 7am im cleaning up the mess a bit and coming back to reality.  I scattered bottles of water around the apartment early on and found 3 empty one of which had been chewed on pretty good.730 am I heat up some left over soup and it warms me from the inside out like never before. I tell the soup that its over between me and the cookies.8am lights out. I roll oaround in the comforter for about an hour have to get up and pee 3 times which was much harder that I wanted it to be. Too much standing up and lights and shiny surfaces.  Back in bed.  The comforter is so comfy I cant sleep just wanna roll in it. I probably made it to sleep between 9 and 10 am.  Had to get up at 1.  Smart that I set the alarm before hand.  you Never wanna tell boss man  sorry im late I was trippin.ps.  I gave 1 vial to a friend of mine a couple weeks later and she said she had the best shroom trip of her life.  She basically stopped eating shrooms due to the nausia.   It never happened this trip.  She felt a vauge upstett tummy a few times but it passed very quickly.  She tripped for 5 or 6 hours then slept for 6 more. Said she woke up feeling as good as she does on any normal day.   I dont always take shrooms but when I do I want them to be from trip.","psychedelics","982",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"556",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I've bought from Trip before and last time bought two vials and tripped with my friend. Being my first time with psychedelics I thought it was mind blowing but I didn't feel as if I had gotten everything I could out of it. So this time I ordered two vials for myself taking advantage of the free vial this awesome vendor gives you the option to get for putting one of these reviews . So I took them around 2:00 after recieving them in the mail. The effects came on like they did last time. A slowly rising warm feeling. A slight giddiness. More vivid colors. I decided to go into my room sit on my bed and put some headphones on to listen to a playlist I had made prior to the trip. The music was very nice and put me in my own little world. After a while though the effects started to get very intense. My blanket is a plaid blanket and it started to rise and fall as if breathing all over in different spots on the blanket. The lines of colors started pulsating starting from my feet to the part of the blanket that reached my chest as if it were feeding me some kind of life through it. It is very hard to explain but that is the best I can do. My walls were breathing. It actually started to scare me because I could not think normally. I then realized I shouldn't have done it knowing my mom would be home in a couple of hours and this is when I started to get nervous. I decided to call my friend over and hit up my hookah. This was also a bad idea. Being that I was tripping balls and he was sober he kept asking me questions about how I felt and what I was seeing constantly. I could not enjoy the effects. He also proceeded to try to have normal conversation with me which only resulted in me responding 30 seconds sometimes minutes later having to focus very hard in order to answer him. I asked him to stop talking to me which he then took the wrong way. It looked like I had hurt his feelings which made me feel worse. So I eventually went into my room to try to listen to my music again. He did the same thing while i was trying to meditate and it made me very self concious. Eventually he left and I was more than relieved but I found that I was kind of stuck with a bad vibe. I could not enjoy what was happening to me anymore. The walls breathing and wierd hallucinations I was having stressed me out. My mind was overflowing with information. Every time I would look at something I would see it from every single point of view possible. It was extremely uncomfortable. I felt a disconection from my body. I didn't feel comfortable inside myself (if that makes sense). This in turn made me even more anxious. Eventually I started to freak out and feel very disoriented and scrambled and did not know what to do with myself. I tried to clean my apartment in order to feel more put together (another mistake as I could not focus and would end up half cleaning things notice I was half cleaning them and then stress out because I could not think straight and my mom was coming home soon.) after 2 hours of this I was so stressed out and anxious that I just curled up in a ball and cried. It was the most scared and miserable I have ever felt though I now realize it was over something that really was not that big of a deal. I am going to take a break from shrooms for a while but this experience tought me many things about myself. I realized I needed to take this drug seriously. It is not something to just take for the hell of it on a boring afternoon. Make sure your environment is clean safe and everything you need is easily accessable. Make sure you have a completely free day and that there is as little stress as possible. That was my first bad trip and I now know better how to avoid one.

Two AUM - 200ug Blotters Arrived sooner than I thought though I wasn't tripping till the weekend got them Thursday so I got a little foil (cling film) and wrapped themI took one at 1:15pm I wrote the time down on a scrap of paper as I thought if this is the real deal Id like to know when I dosed as I know id forget and write down the initial dose on most drugsanyway.. 35 minutes in going on 40 minutes I was still up and cleaning assuming the acid was very weak or I was sent a dud if it was possible.I packed up some clothing etc and began to notice that the net curtains were much clearer and looked as though they were moving in the wind I soon realised I was in for a proper LDS trip I cleaned for another 20 minutes or so and sat down it was going on one hour since I tripped and every minute it was getting stronger having known id only taken 1 tab I was calm I had weed and I only had to walk the dog at some point so no pressure or things to think about.I became very tired and wanted to chill but I knew It was going to be much better going out obviously I couldnt drive so I walked the dog near the sea and in a wildlife forest area at the top the sea was swirling and the boats were creating their own 'drag line' as best as i can put it the whole sea was alive and swirling I spent a lot of time just looking.. even walking on the grass was enjoyable the colours were so vivid and 3D I made it home (with the dog)  I had to lie down as it a little hard trying to deal with all what I was seeing mentally only swirls and colours etc but it was mentally drainingA little to eat and some fruit juice and I was lying looking at pictures I had taken of some nice macro shots of some flowers/corn fields etc.. its amazing how alive they becameI now have another whole tab but I look forward to getting those AIW as I said in the PM felixI also gotta check out what smokes you have thanks once again* Postage/Packing - 9/10* Product/Strength 10/10* Vendor Comms 10/10* Overall Experience 10/10only reason 9/10 is maybe use foil ?

"558",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","My trip report:I had ordered 4 vials to save 1 take 2 and give another 1 to my girlfriend. This was her first time but this would be my fourth time doing mushrooms 3rd time with Trip's product. I downed 2 vials and drank a little of my 3rd and I was out of my mind but I was able to control myself. My girlfriend had issues downing the 1 vial because of the very horrendous taste of the vial just by itself. It wasn't long before my trip went from full-blown to just very chill and relaxing (The intense part of my trip only lasted about a hour to 2 hours). I knew I was just in a state of peace and this was a part of my trip but for my girlfriend it was very different.Â She has had no experience with psychdelics so this was her first time. Her emotions were very hard to tell and she was apparently having some full blown visuals and for someone her body weight and size I can definitely believe it. She kept getting freaked out by very minor things such as people's voices and cars. Mind you we decided to trip at a large recreation center I live nearby. There were people all around but we would occasionally move around and explore in the ditch on the side of it. I had to take care of my girlfriend most of the time because she couldn't handle how intense the trip was getting and it seemed to be getting more and more intense. She would start crying and then I would calm her down and make her happy again almost instantly. She switched back and forth constantly throughout her trip and she also kept talking about how she saw mind-fucking patterns and she was very agitated and confused. She was obviously having a bad trip but it wasn't entirely a bad experience. Her trip also seemed to last more then 6 hours so she had to go home still in confusion and being mind-fucked.Overall I am very satisfied with trip's amazing product and will order again very soon.Â ","psychedelics","356",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

He is a top Australian vendor and out of my 10+ orders with him he has always delived what is promised. I have only ever had one deliver take more then 2 days (next day) and that was because SR2 was having server problems and the vendor could not withdraw funds which is understandable.The Ice has been a little up and down in the past but has always arrived in quantities that have exceeded expectation. The packing has been acceptable and has not drawn any attention. The feedback on his thread from my self and fellow buyers has been nothing but high standard. Dekay has also recently added a 1 gram option which has reduced the price further. While I honestly feel the price for 0.1 grams is a little high. I also trust this vendor so am happy to pay a little extra to insure I get my gear in a timely manner. The price for 1 gram (with current quality) is more then good value compared to all other Australian vendors I have previously purchased from.I have used 4 other ice vendors since starting with SR2. While others have been gracious and fixed problems when they arise Dekay has not had to as I have not had any problems arise. I am just the average man buying gear for a fun weekend. If your an Aussie and are looking for a trusted Vendor then I urge you to try Dekay.

"560",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","So me and my friend decided to try the liquid psilly on a sunny wednesday afternoon. We drank the vials (1 each) around 12:30 pm. It was bitter going down but the taste subsided with some water. We decided head outside and warm up with some sunlight. About 15-20 minutes in things were starting to feel pretty weird. Colors were extremely vibrant. I was playing a reggae dub mix and it sounded amazing extremely appeasing to our ears. We decided to cool off in the pool so we both jumped in where we would spend most of our trip. The water felt extremely sensitizing as if it were sending vibrations throug my body. About 30 minutes in we were giggling hard and we both just felt really high. I was fascinated by looking at the design in and around the pool. The bottom of the pool has was composed of these tiny multi colored pebbles. The light refracting at the base of the pool was also pretty trippy. I kept seeing circles overlap each other over and over again. I visualized the flower of life many times throughout my trip. About 45 minutes to an hour in in I threw some goggles on and decided to swim around the bottom. This was the peak of my trip and as I swam about I saw waves/rays of rainbows float about my vision. Being submerged in the water felt like a full body massage at some points. After swimming I spent some time floating in the water under the sun. As I closed my eyes I experienced some cool closed eye visuals. Geometric shapes swarmed my vision lightly. In addition to this the clouds looked amazing so elegant and whispy. It was as if I was connected with them and could feel them pulsating as they moved. My sense of hearing also felt highly elevated. As me and my friend communicated in the pool I could hear his voice as if he was right next to me although he could of been 6-8 ft away. We exchanged many ideas mostly about the world we live in and how corrupt the government is (lol). Overall the liquid psilocybin felt very clean and was great for proliferating and exchanging thoughts and ideas opening many doors in my mind. The whole trip was about 3.5 - 4 hours.

Research suggests they may have permanent positive effects on the human brain.In fact a mind-altering compound found in some 200 species of mushroom is already being explored as a potential treatment for depression and anxiety. People who consume these mushrooms after “trips” that can be a bit scary and unpleasant report feeling more optimistic less self-centered and even happier for months after the fact.But why do these trips change the way people see the world? According to a study published today in Human Brain Mapping the mushroom compounds could be unlocking brain states usually only experienced when we dream changes in activity that could help unlock permanent shifts in perspective.The study examined brain activity in those who’d received injections of psilocybin which gives “shrooms” their psychedelic punch. Despite a long history of mushroom use in spiritual practice scientists have only recently begun to  examine the brain activity of those using the compound and this is the first study to attempt to relate the behavioral effects to biological changes.After injections the 15 participants were found to have increased brain function in areas associated with emotion and memory. The effect was strikingly similar to a brain in dream sleep according to Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris a post-doctoral researcher in neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London and co-author of the study.“You’re seeing these areas getting louder and more active” he said. “It’s like someone’s turned up the volume there in these regions that are considered part of an emotional system in the brain. When you look at a brain during dream sleep you see the same hyperactive emotion centers.”In fact administration of the drug just before or during sleep seemed to promote higher activity levels during Rapid Eye Movement sleep when dreams occur. An intriguing finding Carhart-Harris says given that people tend to describe their experience on psychedelic drugs as being like “a waking dream.” It seems that the brain may literally be slipping into unconscious patterns while the user is awake.Conversely the subjects of the study had decreased activity in other parts of the brain—areas associated with high level cognition. “These are the most recent parts of our brain in an evolutionary sense” Carhart-Harris said. “And we see them getting quieter and less organized.”This dampening of one area and amplification of another could explain the “mind-broadening” sensation of psychedelic drugs he said. Unlike most recreational drugs psychotropic mushrooms and LSD don’t provide a pleasant hedonistic reward when they’re consumed. Instead users take them very occasionally chasing the strange neurological effects instead of any sort of high.“Except for some naïve users who go looking for a good time…which by the way is not how it plays out” Carhart-Harris said “you see people taking them to experience some kind of mental exploration and to try to understand themselves.”Our firm sense of self—the habits and experiences that we find integral to our personality—is quieted by these trips. Carhart-Harris believes that the drugs may unlock emotion while “basically killing the ego” allowing users to be less narrow-minded and let go of negative outlooks.It’s still not clear why such effects can have more profound long-term effects on the brain than our nightly dreams. But Carhart-Harris hopes to see more of these compounds in modern medicine. “The way we treat psychological illnesses now is to dampen things” he said. “We dampen anxiety dampen ones emotional range in the hope of curing depression taking the sting out of what one feels.”But some patients seem to benefit from having their emotions “unlocked” instead. “It would really suit the style of psychotherapy where we engage in a patient’s history and hang-ups” Carhart-Harris said. “Instead of putting a bandage over the exposed wound we’d be essentially loosening their minds—promoting a permanent change in outlook.”","psychedelics","675",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am not much of a drug guy besides weed or alcohol maybe a little xanax from time to time. But something urged me to try shrooms I wanted to try something crazy but not too much for a guy like me to handle. A friend and I decided on shrooms and found TWS's listing for liquid shrooms. My other friends were skeptical on the quality of ""liquid"" shrooms but I trust most vendors on here so I gave it a go. 1. Product arrived quickly with hands down the best stealth Ive seen on the SR. Very well packaged and shipping was great.2. Customer service is AMAZING. The guy responds every time and loves doing business. 3. Nothing was broken sent everything as described and to be honest the product is fairly cheap.NOW MY review of the trip:We read all through the precautions which he had listed mixed it into some orange juice (dont reccomend made my stomach hurt) and took it at around 10:00pm. We had no idea what to expect so we were inside for about 30 minutes then everything started changing. I would stare at the American flag across the room and it would begin to wave back and forth pulsing in and out. The t.v. grew bigger and smaller and my body began to feel light and fluffyÂ   My friend and I began laughing hysterically at the Pokemon movie we were watching at the time and all of the colors in the room became incredibly vibrant! We decided to walk around the area for a bit down this dirt path near a creek not too far away. NATURE WAS BEAUTIFUL. I had never experienced such a love for nature in my entire life! We spent around two hours walking around admiring the trees and the creek which looked to me like big vibrant green walls surrounding me such a happy feeling set over me. We saw a big red lit area near by and vowed never to go over there because it looked too scary and devilish hahaha so we took our walk elsewhere around the area to a school nearby. We stumbled across the softest grass we had ever laid eyes on and actually spent a few minutes petting and picking the grass. It seemed as if everything was so colorful and beautiful it was almost overwhelming to me! We spent what seemed like 5 hours outside admiring nature and walking around the school and decided to go back to the house to settle in for a bit. We turned on the tv and decided to smoke some weed to intensify the high. The next 45 minutes were INTENSE! The body high was the most incredible warm feeling i have ever experienced. Waves of warm tingly sensation continuously set over me such an amazing feeling. We began eating food and everything especially otter pops had the greatest texture and taste ive ever had. We sat for hours and hours eating and experienced this high in a very chill calming environment.Our friends saw how much fun we were having and kept telling us how much they wanted to try them with us again very soon. I didnt even feel close to having a bad trip and neither did my friend. Definitely an experience I will never forget and hopefully will re-live soon!Â  Thanks trip!NOW FRIENDS trip:My friend and I loved our trip. I remember we went through this open field and found a lacrosse ball and that lacrosse ball gave us entertainment the rest of the night. I felt like that ball was my baby. The trees were colored with the most vibrant green of all time. For some reason I was obsessed with the color blue. We were eating otter pops and they were the greatest tasting otter pops of my life. I felt like I could taste color. The color blue for some reason stood out to me. The different color blues would mesh together and say back and fourth between objects.

"568",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","TWS is a fantastic vendor. Uses great stealth and has a great product.Here's my trip report:I ordered 3 vials from TWS. Unfortuntely one of them was broken but because the clever vacuum sealing the liquid was still inside the bag. I carefully picked out the broken glass and poured the liquid into a cup of soda. I was looking for a stronger trip so I decided to pour another vial in as well. I mixed the concoction and drank it. It definitely had a funny taste but was easy to drink. I tend to feel calmer when I'm not with other people so I drank it at about midnight and had my entire experience alone.I hadn't eaten in a while so it hit me pretty fast. I started feeling it about 20 minutes after I drank it. I listened to some music on my laptop and then I played some audiosurf. I wasn't really trying to play but the combination of the music and the game visuals was awesome. Actually everything was awsome. Just sitting and looking around was awesome. At this point I stared seeing some visuals too. Nothing too severe but when I looked at the wall or carpet it looked like there were small waves flowing on the surface. As I left the room I turned off the lights and the sudden change to darkness was stunning. I just stared off into the blackness for a minute in awe. After remembering what I was going to do I went outside. I only went on a short walk but it felt like a grand adventure to me. I came back and sat on a chair outside staring at the night sky. An overwhelming sense of peace engulfed me. I was in a zen-like state. At this point about 3 hours had passed. Eventually I started to feel the trip fade (although I don't exactly know when). I felt tired and went back up to my room and got in bed. For while couldn't sleep though and I felt restless. I started playing some music and I got lost in the beats again.Â  That quickly calmed me down again and I was able to drift off to sleep. The 3rd vial I took a few days later at my friends birthday party. I felt the same effects but it was not as overwhelming since I only took 1 vial. We just hanged around playing pool and watching tv and stuff like that but it was one of the most fun nights I ever had. We were laughing so hard because everything seemed hilarious and awesome (it should be noted I had some weed as well and several others at the party were pretty high).Based on my experience I highly recommend trying these liquid shrooms. If you are inexerienced or are just looking to have a fun time I suggest taking 1 vial and have a nice trip that's not too overwhelming. If you want a more profound experience take 2 (or more if you're brave) and have powerful trip.","psychedelics","510",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Good StealkTwo Words: Awesome SauceTrip report:I ordered 10 vials from TWS. They came in a package the prevented breaks beacuse it was padded and tightly packed.Wife and I had never done shrooms before and wanted to get are bearings. The liquid smelled and tasted like alcohol(which makes sense if you read of TWS makes this stuff). We mixed it with orange juice and each had half a vial. Taste the same as drinking a screwdriver. We were on an empty stomach and it started to hit us in about 15 minutes. Stomach discomforts that everyone talks about are real. It's even worse once you go for a whole vial. It put us in a real chilled out mood but we didn't get the visuals as we only did half the vial each. We smoked and had a real mellow evening. First real trip Night of 4th of July for fireworks we take a Vial and a half a piece. First big mistake do not drink alcohol the day you trip. Alcohol already fucks with your stomach and it makes the stomach pains all that much worse. Any ways same timeframe for come up ~20 minutes. OH My GOODNESS. This shit is amazing. Your body justs mellows out and everything becomes so vibrant. It's not like LSD with the visuals but you do get vibrant collors streaking and some distortion. It also allows you to actually function. Unlike a LSD trip you are actually able to speak to people and carry on conversation. Your brain does not feel fried. It is a great trip. The other trips we took we spent on a hike in the forrest and admired nature. Each trip was a great experience. Awesome vendor with a great product.

For the sake of space I will only write about my last trip which was also the most intense and interesting.My best friend and I each poured half a vial in shot glasses and took it with fruit punch. It goes down so easily you cant taste a thing!Within 30 minutes we started to trip =)We started out by watching a series of trippy songs with visuals on youtube always a good time when on a hallucinogen!After about a half hour (which felt so much longer!) we got the need to explore. We had my girlfriend drive us to the park so we could go on some swings. (isn't she sweet?) Unfortunately there were too many people at the park for our taste as we were tripping pretty hard at this point. This was a surprisingly intense trip for half a vial.My friend said we should visit this perfect spot on the river. Its where the river flows extremely slowl almost not at all. A giant flat rock extends all the way to the middle of the river. It felt very tranquil. I decided to lay down and watch the clouds for a but now. After a few minutes I sat up laughing exclaiming ""woah the sky just turned purple hahah!""I told my buddy he needed to try it and as soon as he laid down an airplane flew overhead. This plane was taking off as we are directly adjacent to the city airport. It was SUPER intense and we just gasped in awe of what happened until we burst out laughing hysterically again! We then continued to watch the clouds wave back and fouth accross the purple sky until we felt we were ready to move on. We said goodbye to our rock and went back to the car.Next we went on a short drive and ended our journey back at my place where we watched cartoons and enjoyed them like we did when we were kids. We ate some snacks and enjoyed the random bursts of laughter that kept overtaking us. Soon we came all the way back down and called it a night.I had an awesome time both dealing with Trip as a vendor and taking his product. 5 starsA++I will certainly be buying againand again!Thanks Trip!!!","psychedelics","450",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"578",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Casey LSD usually starts as LSD tartrate.  This is a salt in crystalline form (which we call xtal for short; why? No clue).  As the person above me pointed out this is also called the ""raw"" form because it is the most concentrated form possible.  You can dissolve salt in water right?  And if you lay the water (or ethanol because it evaporates faster) onto paper and let the water dry the salt recrystallizes in the paper as it precipitates out (un-dissolves; the water is so hot it evaporates but that's nowhere near the temperature required to evaporate the LSD so it stays behind as it crystallizes).The thing I want to clarify is that this is not a ""variant"" or ""type"" of LSD.  It's not like a marijuana strain.  It is more of a physical form.  It is literally the difference between saltwater (a solution) and straight up salt.  Same compound just a different form.  LSD xtal is always intended to be the exact same thing; the only thing that will differ is the purity and I personally doubt that impurities will actually alter the resulting experiences in any other way besides reduction of intensity because of the reduction in purity.  It's honestly a lot more likely that differences in acid trips come from differences in mental states neurological states (hardcore shit like hormone levels) or some other chaotic factor.The reason people sell xtal (or ""raw"") LSD is for people who want to lay their OWN blotters rather than buy some from someone else.  LSD is very potent in this form because it is very diluted when you lay it on blotters.  If you have a jug full of water and you add one drop of food coloring stir it up and then take a drop out it will not be very (dark (it will be diluted); this is a blotter.  The xtal is the drop of food coloring on its own (concentrate). It makes a lot more sense when you talk about weights.  House White blotters are rated at 150ug that's 150 millionths of a gram.  SunWu has 10mg LSD crystal up for somewhere around $500.  That's 100 hits!  In powder form!  A reasonable taste would most likely render you insane and the tiniest little finger dip would leave you tripping for days.","psychedelics","384",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I really really want to make some GHB and I'd trust none other than your crew to get the necessary precursor GBL to me. Your only ""competition"" is GBL4U who lacks in customer service prompt shipping and (possibly) stealth.Some research on the legality of GBL yielded the following:QuoteThe Netherlands: GBL can be freely bought as a cleaning agent. Retailers do not need a licence to sell the substance.[21]Poland: GBL is not classified as a drug and can be purchased in chemistry shops as a solvent.United Kingdom: Because of their legitimate uses regulation 4B of the 2001 regulations makes it lawful to import export produce supply offer to supply or possess GBL and 14-BD. Except where a person does so knowing or believing that they will be used for the purpose of human ingestion.[4][23]Seeing as your operation has as least some footing in the UK do you think this would be possible to source for export to the USA? To give context here's the USA law:QuoteUnited States: GBL is regulated as a List 1 controlled chemical. As a GHB analog it is treated as a controlled substance under Schedule I of the ""Controlled Substances Act"" if intended for human consumption.[24]I'm sure you're no stranger to the laws surrounding List 1 controlled chemicals and how difficult it can be to source them in the US. If you could organize your US distributor to stock GBL for domestic shipment I would pay good money for bulk GBL.Some R&D would need to be done in packaging US-US due to weight limits for the blue boxes as would there need to be research done on getting GBL through customs by my oh my I would sell my left testicle to have the privilege of buying it from you Sunwu.The UK pricing for GBL has to be low (GBL4U sells 1L bottles for $220 and has been able to afford to double orders in the past). Yield for 1L GBL is just under 1.5kg GHB - which from BlueGiraffe is over $1000. You can see why sourcing GBL is worth it when weighing costs.If you could offer reasonably priced pure BASF-quality GBL (free of bitterants/trace contaminants) I have a strong feeling it'd sell like hotcakes. The GBL --> GHB synthesis is probably the easiest drug synthesis out there (easier than P2NP --> Amphetamine sulfate) and can be done using just GBL NaHCO3 (baking soda food-grade synth) and dH20. You don't even need lye.Synthesis link here for a one-pot GHB synth you can see how easy it really is:Quotehttp://chemistry.mdma.ch/hiveboard/methods/000250972.htmlPlease help end the GHB drought in the US Sunwu.

I certainly owe you a trip report:The on-set is subtle yet distinctly bubbly and pleasant. I remember gradually becoming more giggly and overwhelmingly happy with my surroundings. At peace and in touch with nature my friends and I set out to a waterfall. The trees seemed to ""breathe"" colors were more vivid and everything around me was distinctly alive. i had fits of micropsia while urinating and only during that release. Sounds seem detached from their sources as though the balance on the speaker was being freely thrown from 360 of my perspective. Merriment and silliness ensued. Returning to our campsite the trip wound down with the sun and a beautiful afterglow ensued. I would say my trip's duration was about 4.5-5.5 hours I consumed 1.75 grams. Based on previous experiences with psilocybin the cyanascens were overtly more pleasant. I tend to describe LSD as a feminine psychedelic in that it gently ushers you into its high taking time to smell the roses and let what happens happen. Whereas psilocybin is very masculine dragging you by the arm into the trip that is to be. The cyanascens were quite ""feminine"" in that sense I never felt scared paranoid or that I was having a less than stellar time.Days following the experience seemed more magical. I felt renewed spiritually and more awakened than I had been in a long time. Sad to see you're not in stock at the moment hopefully that changes soon!

"584",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","My trip report:I took the one vial I received at around 10:30 in the morning in a glass of cranberry juice. I'd eaten a banana so I did have a little in my stomach and that slowed down the breakdown of the psilocybin. I decided to go for a walk to help it kick in get the blood flowing. When I did that I walked past a playground where I used to hang out as a kid and there was a kid swinging. As I walked past him I did some meditation on the nature of how happy we are as kids making some obvious generalizations about the power of disillusionment that comes in when we age—pretentious stuff like that. I was a little disappointed upon coming home that my trip visuals and thoughts weren't as strong as what I'd experienced before on LSD but I wanted to give it time—that it had struck this early (with some strong body highs around an hour after consumption) was satisfying as I usually had to wait around two hours maybe even three for other psychedelics. I peaked at around an hour and a half in wherein I smoked some hashish. Hashish and psychedelics have always gone really well for me—time moves slowly on psychedelics and the stuff from these vials was no exception so I was getting a really strong euphoric hash high that seemed to last weeks or months. Cannabis high usually makes the trip into a real trip—i.e. journey—for me. I started to have divine hallucinations—hallucinations of a religious nature manifesting in a way befitting my sober religious beliefs—that were much more “cosmic” in scope than my LSD trip. It felt more organic and I began to see the biotic structure of the mushroom that the chemical had been made from—that made the high feel “herbal” or “earthy” for me. I remembered that one of the most common mushrooms in this experience was called the Golden Teacher—I couldn't remember if Trip's serum contained Golden Teacher or not but I definitely felt like that was an appropriate name for some reason. At one point I had a higher dose of hash which made me begin to have even stronger religious visions. Visions of white light. My ego almost certainly died somewhere along the way and I felt a strong bliss which made me feel like I was going to start weeping. Eventually I did come down from this but for awhile I was paralyzed with pure bliss. It's hard to tell how much of this came from the psilocybin and how much came from the hash—I'm new to hash in truth used to weed and so hash highs are still really intense for me. I liked the organic feel the psilocybin gave me. I feel like I'd need to be in a very particular mood to get that sort of “earthy guidance” on acid. I'd be curious to try a higher dose of the product possibly a vial and a half. I'm starting to feel comfortable with the ego death aspect of a trip and the liquid psilocybin has really helped accentuate that feeling of relaxation. I only wish it lasted longer—maybe a higher dose would help with that.Recommended.","psychedelics","538",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"585",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I've never had psylocibin tincture before.  I'm in my mid thirties and I enjoyed shrooms a lot in college but gave them up due to stomach problems.  I like psylocibin a lot I like the level 4 potential of large doses of psylocibin and I would like to integrate psylocibin into my rotation.  Currently as far as psychadelics go I rotate between LSD 25i 25c DOC and DOM. I like to do DMT (nn DMT + 5-MEO-DMT freebase is favored) on top of these especially LSD.  Sometimes the lethal potential of 25i 25c DOC and DOM discourage me from doing DMT on them (at least at their peaks).  That means I only feel truly comfortable stacking DMT on LSD for a smooth transition into and out of level 4 (level 3 LSD (3 hours) -> level 4 DMT (10 minutes) -> level 3 DMT/LSD combo (50 minutes) -> repeat the DMT 1-2 times as desired -> level 3 LSD for the rest of the trip).  Now psylocibin is great for stacking DMT because like LSD is has a high safety profile and it even has its own legitimate level 4 potential to boot (LSD definitely does not have level 4 potential on its own - at least I never met anyone who said that it did and I didn't get to level 4 off of a crystal thumb print of LSD so I'm pretty certain LSD tops out at level 3).  So I'd like to rotate in psylocibin to add more variety to the rotation and to serve as a potent yet safe base for stacking DMT.As I turns out I got some DMT in the mail the same day as I got 5 vials of psylocibin tincture from Trip.  I tried the DMT first and quite frankly it was a little weak.  I spent about 2 hours in level 3 after fiddling around with several different methods of ingestion and basically wasting 250mg of DMT.  As I was coming down I decided to down a vial of psylocibin tincture to extend the DMT and serve as a base for DMT stacking later on.  The vial smelled strongly of ethanol.  It reminded me of doing L - brown glass vial full of trip potential that smells of ethanol.  Of course unlike a vial of LSD+ethanol you gotta down at least half of one of Trip's psylocibin+ethanol vials to get a good trip on.  I decided to do one complete vial with the possibilit of a booster vial a few hours later.  The first thing I noticed was the ethanol.  I'm not sure about Trip's tincture method but some may find the ethanol unpleasant.  It's not that hard on the taste buds but 1 vial has about the same amount of alchohol as 1/4 shot of Everclear (about 1/2 shot of Jack Daniels).  So I'm thinking about taking all of the remaining 4 that I have all at once to see if I can't dip into level 4 on psylocibin alone - I never got there on schrooms because I couldn't eat enough fast enough (and keep them down) to induce level 4.  But 4 vials contains about a shot of Everclear (about 2 shots of Jack Daniels). That's definitely gonna get me a little drunk during the first 1:30.  Other possible tincture bases might include apple cider vinegar (harder on the taste buds and the stomach lining than ethanol) and vegetable glycerin (much harder to work with than ethanol).  So anyway with these vials there's gonna be some ethanol and maybe a light alcohol intoxication during the first 1:30 depending on how many you do at once.I didn't notice any effect from the alcohol after taking only 1 vial but I did notice the psylocibin almost immediately.  I still had some DMT working and the psylocibin kicked in almost immediately.  I'm thinking some psylocibin might get dephosphorized into psylocin due to heat or light during manufacture and/or transport.  I stored my extras wrapped in cloth in the freezer.  Now psylocin is a really unstable chemical which is why its best to transport psylocibin and let the body dephorize it into to psylocin.  But despite it's instability I think any psylocin in the tincture is going to keep because its immersed in ethanol in a dark vial. I'd just be sure to drink from your vial as soon as you open it and to get it straight down your throat as fast as possible (and put the cap back on if you're only doing half).  In any case I started feeling the tincture strongly after only 30 mintues.  I got ready to puke and void my bowels because that's why I do on schrooms (or even on large doses of L).  However try as I might I couldn't bring myself to do either.  I was literally so NOT sick that I couldn't see any benifit in forced puking.  This is pretty rare for me.  I mean we're talking an actual positive feeling in my entire digestive system.I then orally dosed 400mg THC from cherry syrup smoked a small bowl of bud and did a few hash oil hits.  The THC and psylocibin came on stronger and stronger and I ended up spending about 3-4 hours listening to the Grateful Dead and tripping of tapestries and posters in my place.  At that point the DMT was totally gone and I had decided not to redose psylocibin tincture.  I was getting solid level 3 visuals off of just the 1 vial and the THC.  I was also starting to feel a bit tired so I ate a sandwich drank an energy shake took 2 Sudafed and drank 2 shots of Espresso.  That proved too much for the bowls and I struggled with diaharrhea over the next two hours most of which I spent in and out of the bathroom while trying to talk to my sister on the phone - I had to get _her_ to stop freaking out because her dog was acting up.  I took some immodium and moved forwad.  I don't blame the tincture for the bowel problems by the way.  I should have planned out my food more carefully.I decided to try stacking some DMT on the psylocibin and had no success getting to level 4 after buring another 250mg of this so-called ""DMT.""  After the first hit I even shit myself 'cause the immodium still hadn't kicked in.  Finally I gave up and thought about taking some benzos and going to bed - not that I wasn't getting to a very high level 3 off the DMT + psylocibin but I was fiending for level 4 and feeling disappointed.  I put on a playist and started drifting off when suddenly I decided to hot nail and dome some 100 mg DMT hits.  First one got me to level 4 in about 30 seconds and kept me there for about 10 minutes.  Of course it felt like about 2 hours.  I was conscious most of the time (maybe 75%) and I remember a lot of it (maybe 50%).  Ego-death depersonalization strong aural hallucinations talking to ""entities"" transcending to the ""astal plane"" - the entire level 4 exprienced plus unreal OEVs and CEVs.  Yes!  I let the playlist (Zeppelin/Floyd) run out in 45 minutes.  Then I hot nailed another 100mg with similar results (Guns N Roses/AC-DC).  Yes!  Then I hot nailed another 100mg (Clapton) - and I f'd it all up. I got maybe 10mg in my lungs and shot liquid DMT all over my gear.  I was a little disappointed but I figured I still got 300 mg of this junky DMT left I got two nice level 4's this time and I'll probably get two 2 or (hopefully) 3 more with the LSD up next in my rotation.  I spent the next 45 mintues clamly cleaning the DMT off the gear and riding out what was left of the DMT and psylocibin trip.  I was still frying about 1:30 later.  So I cut it off nicely with some beers and benzos. I'm writing this report and then I'm gonna get some shut eye.Oh and PS: coming out the level 4 DMT trip into the psylocibin was a pleasure.  I've had good success with about 500 - 1000 ug of LSD as a base for DMT.  The one vial of psylocibin did a nice job but I could have used a slightly stronger base.  I bet 2-4 vials would make a comparable base for DMT to 500 - 1000 ug of LSD. -junky2 (Agora) a.k.a. jjrkl (Silk Road)","psychedelics","1429",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"588",NA,"sunwu lsd review","My first ever silk road purchase was last weekend... I did all my homework and went into this feeling very confident.I purchased 10 tabs of lsd from sunwu pimpit and tessellated. I ordered saturday july 19 and sunwu's arrived on Thursday july 24. Pretty solid shipping time. I wanted 30 tabs but didn't want to get scammed that's why i ordered from the top 3 (i guess 3 out of 4) canadian LSD vendors.I had all my lsd by Friday. Anyway not knowing what to expect i decided to try sunwu's on friday night because he advertised the lowest dose per tab (150mics) so i wanted to lower the bar of expectation. FORTUNATELY sunwu raised the bar.At about 10:30pm friday my fiance my friend and myself decided to drive to niagara falls and drop acid. My fiance and I have dropped acid many times smoked dmt dropped mushrooms. We're lucky to have always received high quality products (especially mushrooms and dmt) but lsd all of a sudden became impossible to find... accidentally dropped some RC a few weeks ago and we decided immediately to buy LSD off silk road no more fucking around. The third wheel had smoked dmt 2 weeks ago and we blew his mind. So he was eager to drop.We got into our hotel room around 11:40pm and we dropped just 1 tab each of sunwu's lsd. By 12:30/1:00 the lsd was kicking in and my god it was clean easy visual and ecstatic. I won't bore you with the details but it was LSD. 150mics sounds very accurate. It was a beautiful 150mic acid trip. Just an experiment and it DELIVERED. We were spun until sunrise. Drove back home around 11am. The casino the music the waterfall the lights the people the sounds... it was one hell of a spontaneous psychedelic trip and SUNWU delivered! i can't say anything about any of his other products but the LSD was awesome lsd. Sunwu certainly raised the bar for tessellated and pimpit but i probably wont drop again until the ontario civic holiday in august. I will try tessellated next but i guess my point is: Canadian lsd buyers sunwu is totally legit. It was my first lsd purchase and it was the first package i received. Everything went smoothly and i received my package within the same week that i placed my order.Silk road has not gone downhill at least not in the LSD department because all 3 vendors delivered.

First time i bought five second time i bought two (one of which my friend C kept for a while in her fridge) and the third time i bought one more. Stealth is excellent as always and it got to me in about five days. We did this on Monday (at about 6:30 P.M.) with outstanding weather and an excellent setting. My friends room is ""Hippy-Like"" with piece signs and awesome lights and pictures with a cool temerature. Before we drank the viles (mixed it with orange juice) we decided to do a point of Molly before hand (Hippy Flipp) then drank the shrooms. The first time i tried his shrooms i felt VERY natious for about 15 minutes then it wore off. This time i did not feel anything. We were laying on her bed listening to some chill trap music and in 15 minutes is when we first started noticing color changes and small shadows. She made a little poster wall with a lot of trippy and colorfull pictures which started to slowly melt together and it looked very cool. We didn't stay in the house for too long but instead went to a little playground after 30 or so minutes. This is where it started to get fun. The little playground had a slide and a couple climbing bars. We layed on the fortress thing (i wish i could attach pictures to show you what it looked like) and the roof of it was a dome like roof that was yellow and it started to change colors spin and shadows started to come out. After about an hour of laying there we decided to get up and go sit at a bench that was fairly close to the park. Someone came to the playground so we felt a little unsafe and left. This bench was perfect. It looked over beautiful trees and a pond. The trees is what really got me going. There was absolutely NO wind on that day but it looked like all the trees were moving and my friend C started to freak out a little bit because she was trying to comprehend what was happening. I calmed her down and we were fine after that. We went on a walk in the woods on a trail which also was an awesome experience. We started to head back and she realized that her knee was cut but we didnt have any bandaids so we decided to walk to Safeway. I haven't been in a public place before on shrooms but i wasn't worried because i was also rolling. First of all it took us about ten minutes to find where the band aids were and another ten to decide which ones to get. We started to laugh real hard because we were just staring at the shelf and everything was changing colors and shifting. Greatest safeway trip i ever made.Â  All in all by midnight almost all the effects were gone with little color distortions i notice when i looked at my phone. To pass out we ended up smoking a few bowls. All in all it was a perfect dose for a perfect day with a perfect person. The people that you trip with is always the most important factor. But you dont want to be somewhere public either. Thanks TWS and i will buy again soon.","psychedelics","572",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"591",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Soon after I placed my order with Trip I was greeted with a message explaining the methods of this market what to expect from his product and safety information. It's this type of above and beyond work that sets Trip apart from other vendors. I placed my order on a Monday afternoon and I was full bore tripping balls on Saturday afternoon. The packaging was clever and discreet no details here but the man exceeded all expectations with his stealth.About me: I've never tripped before but I've consumed copious amounts of pot. I've done my fair share of researching all sorts of drugs and find human biology absolutely fascinating. I'm a medium sized dude.I downed one vial of Trip's shrooms at about 5:30 PM - officially beginning my hobby as a psychonaut. The liquid tasted (and smelled) like mushrooms dissolved in ethanol and there was no problem throwing it back like a little shot of shroomy vodka. I had no stomach issues and actually ate a quick meal shortly after taking the vial with no problem.At 6:00 PM I started feeling the effects of the shrooms solid objects such as walls and floors seemed a bit more fluid and weak than usual. Eventually I hopped in the shower and have never felt hot water so vivdly.By 7:00 I was laying in my bed with a random Pandora station playing. I proceeded to melt into the world for a couple hours rolling around on my bed as my I flew through space and pushed the boundaries of my own perception. I have never felt music so vividly. I was feeling no ill side effects and never felt my mind slip towards anxious and fear-filled thoughts. I'm assuming this would be described as quite a 'clean' trip. I tried to do some writing but could only scribble a few words about 'the world merging with me'.Around 9:00 I was feeling less heavy in the body and actually had a ton of energy. My dog started growing multiple heads and was pretty mutated so I decided to check how things were outside. Sure enough the sky had turned purple and my house was breathing! My first reaction to this new found world was to eat a leaf. Fuck you I don't know why I did it but it happened. I was feeling pretty happy and comfortable and took the next half hour to gather myself for a bike ride.I left my house at about 9:30 and then lost all sense of time. I left my house with my mp3 player and my bike. I rode all around town and had an absolutely incredible time letting the wind hit my face. The shadows of trees looked like tentacles trying to capture me but I knew my brain was just playing around so it became a fun game. I made my way to a wooded peninsula surrounded by water and then played in the woods and took in the sets for what seemed like an eternity. The landscape that I knew so well had become an elaborate Martian landscape. Although I was playing like an 8-year old I felt absolutely in control of myself and very safe while Tripping. I made it home by midnight and listened to my room-mate play some guitar on his amp. Pretty awesome that he had the ability to make the walls vibrate with the guitar strings. I was feeling energetic still so we smoked some pot and I watched him play video games for a while. The pot didn't cause any issues and I honestly didn't feel much of it. Eventually I went back to my room laid in bed and proceeded to have closed eye visuals for a couple hours before passing out. I felt fantastic the next day but I was tired from biking way harder than usual.Holy shit Trip - THANK YOU.I've got one more vial and can't wait to give 'er a go next week.If this isn't the place for a trip report I apologize. But Trip is the fuckin man and deserves my time. I hope you guys enjoy my little story if you haven't ordered and are interested then do it quick.","psychedelics","699",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Got my vials after just a couple of days then waited in extreme anticipation for Friday night.As recommended I poured the vial into a glass of orange juice. The liquid was undetectable and the OJ was delicious. I was completely unprepared for the extremely fast come-up. The last time I did shrooms was nearly 10 years ago so my reasoning went like this: ""Each vial is roughly equivalent to 2g and I used to trip shrooms back in the day so I should probably do both vials.""I am glad I didn't do both. One vial was more than enough to put me in a state that helped me remember something I haven't recognized in a long time: beauty.I did end up vomiting but I believe that was primarily my body wanting to purge the junk I had eaten that day. The experience of vomiting was amazing like La Purga purging all of the negativity from my being.The feeling of pure bliss is inexplicable. I put on some Sphongle followed by Alien Dreamtime/McKenna and discovered things about myself and nature that I had long forgotten.Words aren't enough to describe such an experience but needless to say I'll be back for more!

I just ate and it was perfect)PIMPIT stealth 10/5 it was really funny and smart.####################### UPDATE #3 Alright guys we couldn't do it the day we intended to but we finally did it yesterday and I can only say it was amazing for the five of us ! It was amazing we cut the blotters and put one each (supposed to be around 250ug) under our tongue for about 45 minutes until we swallow it without really noticing it (the effects were starting to come up). I can say that I had absolutely no mindfuck eveything was clear unlike with mushroom. I had a better notion of time and could easily say that anything weird happening was because of the LSD. At some point it was hard to talk but it was just funny and we all were able to ""let go"". This drug really makes you think really quickly and everything that is happening is quick the mistake that some people do is try to ""stay in a certain mood"" or ""focus on one mindset"" if it makes sense you must learn to let go completely forget about other people around you do not think about if they're going to judge you for laying flat on the grass and closing your eyes : if you feel like doing it DO IT.I bought 3-4 lightsticks and even though it sounded stupid at first once on the drug it was amazing. We carried them around all night and the glow it produced really brought a great mood to everybody it was like we could carry a ""positive vibe"" around and could feel the energy and heat it produced.We listened to some pink floyd at first but it wasn't enough at a certain point we put on some electro and messed around with the glow sticks it was like if the toys and the music were made just for this drug..Do this in a small group with positive people that you trust think about what could make you uncomfortable before hand (or when the blotter is in your mouth) and talk about it with the others it releases the anxiety because everybody's there for you. I can say I didn't think once about anhything bad that stresses me IRL it was just a 6-7 hours intense trip followed by a smooth (but still very intertaining and funny) 5 hours where we just hung out drank a little bit talked about the night while trying to remember everything that made us laugh our asses off....Oh a swimming pool we all went in the pool then in a hot tub and it was amazing not a single time I had any stupid idea like ""breathe under water"" or ""jump off the roof"" the dosage was really perfect and my ideas were clear the whole time.. You make associations with anything and everybody understand your jokes before you even complete it it's really an amazing substance to experiment.My report probably doesn't make any sense or has no structure but I don't really mind I'm just writing everything that's coming to my mind today haha !I can say I feel no after-effects I feel really refreshed today and could do anything normally. We did it at about 5pm yesterday effects came up at around 5h45pm it was really intense (yet very manageable) for a while and from about 2am to 5am we were 100% lucid still some visual effects and ""cloudy"" feeling still the funny vibe and the positive energy around anything (but it may have been the fact that we were all tired..).I skated my way back home and put my alarm clock at 1pm slept about 6 hours and I can't say I'm feeling anything different than before I'd say I'm ""closer to people"" due to the nice social vibe that the drug was.. A babysit isn't necessary I'd even say the two people that were there ""for us"" almost disturbed the night.. If you are with intelligent lucid and not psychotic people just do it in a small group and read a lot about the substance carry the time around and be in a safe environnement like an empty house backyard out at night etc.Thanks for everybody I bought twice on silkroad and both of these purchases ended up being really amazing !

"594",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Trip Report for 4gs of liquid shroomsThis is the second time I’ve done shrooms and the first time was 2 grams of liquid shrooms as well.I was quite excited when I finally had the chance to partake in my second trip. I had vails of shrooms from Trips with Science stored away in my closet awaiting the right day. My first experience with the liquid shrooms was incredible and the thought of doubling the dose really appeled to me. Wanting to figure out the true nature of the fungi I decided I would ingest the liquid alone in my dark room with only my headphones and time. I poured the vails into a bottle of Gatorade and chugged it down. There was almost no taste and I can imagine it being much more pleasant than attempting to chew up dried shrooms. After I finished the bottle I turned a stopwatch on and waited for the first effects. I first noticed that I felt a little weird at around the 20 minute mark. My body felt as if there was a sheet of plastic over it and I could feel electricity flowing through me. I knew at this time that I was in for a treat. The electricity like feeling gradually increased as the minutes passed by while I looked around the room and noticed colors morphing. At around the hour mark things started to get really intense and I put the song “Sierra Leone” on my headphones. As I closed my eyes I was immediately transported to the top of a snowy mountain. I could not hold back my joy and started laughing very hard at the pure beauty of the scene. I continued to flip through songs on my phone and each time the song changed I was greeted by new surroundings.  This went on for 2 whole hours and I was not the least bit bored. Finally after I got up to go the bathroom the effects started to wear down just a little bit I became more engulfed in deep thought rather than the aesthetics of the trip. I thought about my future my friends and felt a profound sense of serenity as I realized how great it was to be living on this wonderful earth and looked forward to a lifelong relationship with this amazing medicine. The whole experience lasted 5 hours and at the end of it I was not tired or exhausted in the slightest. I was basking in the afterglow of the experience for a while and finally decided to go out and get a bite to eat. I write this report not only to inform others about the magic of shrooms but also to thank Trips with Science for allowing me to have this wonderful experience.

I waited for fhe right time to try...I am 6'2"" at about 250lbs. I dumped a full vial in about a quarter of bottled flavored water I had left just to sip it slowly because if you are gonna do drugs you gotta do them right. The vials do have an alcohol scent but I did not taste any in my water.I started sipping the water while doing laundry around 5:30pm on an empty stomach. Sure enough within 25 min I was feeling a slight shift. Perception changed a bit. I sipped more. Effects grew. At about 6:30pm I had sipped a decent amount and was definitely feeling different. Slightly smiley stoned lifted. Aware. I headed out in my car to meet my girlfriend. I kept my bottle of mushroom water close. Music in my car was amazing I was high but not intoxicated to affect my driving. As I neared her house I sipped more. Effects grew to full smiles and increased perception cognition. Very smiley very happy. Also calm. By 7:45-8pm I finished my water. Overall because I sipped it over a period it waa never too intense. Never really a trip just a prolonged lifted spirit. I was at peace as I relaxed with my girlfriend and watched anime shows  and some cartoons. Just what I needed. I was smiling in awe child like wonder at the scenarios in the cartoons. I smiled and laughed like never before. Naturally from mushrooms. Again I took a full vial over a prolonged course of time at 6'2"" 250lbs. It was never too intense to call a trip but I was definitely lifted with dialated pupils for hours.  I did feel some slight nausea. Not from the vial but that psychedelic gag feeling where you feel like gagging with a fake nausea most likely from the way psychedelics are causing changes in perception. LSD sometimes has this effect on me. I hold the reflex down and keep drinking regular pure H20 to stay hydrated. An empty stomach complety may also be a cause for me.I would highly reccommend this. It is a unique Idea. Clever. It takes time and care. TRIP is excellent at this process of extraction. As soon as I get more BTC they are going towards more vials. Also I eventually ate dinner with my girlfriend thus starting a come down of sleepiness and yawns. I had to work at 4am and went to bed at 11pm  and awoke with no problems or hangover. Pure natural bliss from mother nature.Please buy these and share with your friends. My experience was indeed undescribable but this is the best I can do. Perhaps I can achieve a stronger intense high by downing a full vial at once and not sipping over a period of time!Trips customer service is top notch. He is down to earth personal and quick.

Within 40 minutes everything in my field of vision was melting (I've read reports that this LSD is ""not visual""?!). I had quite an intense ride with profound synesthesia and time dilation not to mention the unbelievable body high. As intense as any LSD trip I've ever had. Fortunately this was in a private setting because I would have lost my shit in public!Having tried a quarter and half of a tab on earlier occasions I would say they are around 150 Âľg since half kept me relatively clear-headed with mild visuals. Interestingly while I experienced a slight body load on lower doses (especially mucus production and GI discomfort) a full tab was quite easy on the body.In any case while the dosage is likely lower than advertised you probably shouldn't believe the hate that pimpit has been getting.","psychedelics","167",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"598",NA,"top_gear_uk lsd review","This is where I shall be posting a review here for Top_Gear_UK's LSD in the near future. I have used him before and everything was great(probably some of the best service I have had on silkroads): I ordered one of his 250ug Hofmann Print Blotters(I don't think he sells singles of this anymore I think the minimum you can get is now 3) It was my first time using LSD so he advised me to only take half which I did and it was more than enough for a good trip. The blotter had no taste and I felt no unwanted side affects so I'm 100% sure what Top_Gear is selling is legit acid. Top_Gear_UK is a legit vendor and I would already reccomend him.I look forward to receiving my next order of his LSD so I can post a better more updated and a bit more detailed review for his service and LSD.Â ","psychedelics","154",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Very happy with that.It took only 2 days domestic. No problems with this vendor so far.I am yet to try the latest order but can give a review of the first batch i recieved.I ordered 3 of his 250's for my first order and can say they are the cleanest tabs I have ever had.Better than what I got off SR1 and Sheepmarket. Absolutely no taste. My friend and I thought we had duds for the first hour they were so clean. When they kicked in shortly after and we both had a very pleasant clean fun trip.Highly recommend this guy if you like your acid.I would very much like to see his 300Âľg tabs make a return.I never got a chance to try those and its a shame some people were blaming him for bad trips ruining it for the rest of us.","psychedelics","180",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"600",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Let me start off saying that Trip has got to be one of the best vendors on SR just based on customer service alone. Received an email right away with a shipment update and detailed instructions and I had a couple of questions about the product that were answered extremely fast and in a very helpful manner. Noone else quite like Trip in this regard.I actually ordered twice within a week from him because I had initially planned on tripping with my buddy (ended up tripping on LSD myself that time while he took a vial) and decided one wasn't enough. Both arrived within 3 days with great packaging and stealth.The one vial my friend took got him good. He poured it in a drink (can't remember what he put it in exactly) and brought up how he couldn't taste it at all. The effect started in pretty quick for him within 30 minutes (last time we had regular shrooms it was a bit longer). He didn't have any complaints about being sick on his stomach so we had some weed edibles and after a while the combo had him tripping pretty hard but it was fun. Went outside to enjoy nature a bit he kept on bringing up how amazing hands are we played some video games even though we were both so out of it we just ended up laughing at whatever it was we were doing because we had no idea what was going on. So he definately had a good time on his vial and wants to try Trip's stuff again for sure maybe even two vials.My own personal trip wasn't as strong as I think my buddy's was though that might just be due to the fact that I had the LSD just a week before. I ended up tripping by myself on a weekend afternoon poured into some sports drink (which may have had an effect on the come up). Came on quicker than my buddy's trip (around 20min)  though I had a slight bit of nausea but it wasn't near as bad as the last time I had shrooms plus I had just eaten some crappy pizza so that probably didn't help. Overall I was pleased with the effects I had a sense of joy and happiness stared around at nature in the back yard and enjoyed all the brightness and colors while the dogs played. Then watched some cartoons and other stuff while feeling pretty weirded out in a good way. Only reason I say it wasn't quite as strong as my friend's is that the strongest effects seemed to wear off quicker than his trip (or my last trip) and I didn't really have any closed eye visuals or ego death. Still was enjoyable for sure but next time I'll have to space out the time between trips better or try two vials.So yeah don't hesitate to try Trips stuff this is the best way yet I've found to do shrooms and it was well worth it just for my buddy's trip alone.","psychedelics","513",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"602",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","It's just incredible what magic mushrooms can do for you. I've been addicted to stimulants for a good number of years now and I decided to make a change 2 years ago and stop everything. I tried my best out of my own will to make some positive changes but was always just so drought out and drained of energy from all my past substance abuse. Way too much hurt and pain that I couldn't fully recover from.I took 2 vials split into 3 hours intervals by myself in my room. I mostly just listened to music during the trip on my first vial and at times I would remember staring at things in my room just trippin out. The coolest thing I remember was seeing these heiroglyphics written all over the shirt I was wearing. It kinda looked like some sacred writing from God that was live and glowing. And just everything in the room had flow like vibrations and energy. It was crazy. After coming down from my first trip I stepped outside to smoke a j I decided to take my second vial because I felt like I fell short of the experience that I wanted. It wasn't until my second vial where I felt true spiritual and emotional healing. I remember at a point during the trip I felt as if I was caged in my own room. I felt trapped and stuck. I stood up immediately and moved to my Grandma's vacant room next door and the next thing you know I just started bawling and reflecting on my past from all the bad decisions I made. I think just seeing my Grandma's belongings had this huge emotional impact on me because I'm so disrespectful to her as a grandson and she's always been the one taking care of me while my parents' were busy working. But yeah this kinda sums of my trips with a few giggles here. Mind you this is my first time experiencing psilocybin and I now really understand the healing properties of it. I'm probably gonna order some more in the very near future to share with a couple of my friends. Trip is a true professional in the way he conducts his transactions.

I don't have time right at this moment to go into all the details -- but I hope I do at some point because it was seriously profound.  I cannot believe how much I learned in one single evening.

"605",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Well I got my order today and was extremely excited to try it out so here's a very brief report that will mainly focus on what to expect from taking this.Setting: friend's house with 3 people excluding myself. Mindset: pretty much a neutral mindset. A bit on the anxious and excited side to try this product.Experience: Being somewhat new to psycs as I've only done DXM and 25-I nbome. Dxm at least once a week for about 4 months. 25-i only a few timesThe Trip: took the vial at around 4pm mixed with a shot worth of Arizona tea to mask the taste. Did pretty well actually. I was on a semi empty stomach since I only had 2 waffles at 2pm. Felt feeling ""something"" after about 10 minutes. And I say something because it was not really explainable. At the 20 minute mark I was definitely getting hit with the effects. Walls begin to move and ""breathe"" the ceiling started making faces and eyes. Though they weren't actually faces more as they were skulls. However the eyes were just nornal human eyes. Everything began to appear high def and colors were definitely more noticeable. Occasionally I would look at my skin and it would begin moving as well. This wasn't a bad thing I found it funny actually. My thought process occasionally drifted and I would end up starting to say one thing and end with another. I laughed a lot. I felt a lot of joy. The trip lasted around 2-3 hours and now (9pm) I can still get minor visuals if I try. I have a slight headache though but it's nothing major. Overall I really enjoyed the experience but I wish it lasted longer. Hopefully if I get the free vial that Trip includes on your next order if you make a report I can extend the trip to last a few more hours. And I suggest tripping either with people you feel very comfortable around and who you know won't fuck with you while you trip cause even though I really enjoy the people I was with I couldn't get the full tripping mood that I usually get alone. Anyways great product very fast delivery and Trip answered any questions I had and I'm sure he'll answer yours too! Happy Trippings!","psychedelics","386",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"606",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Okay So friends the following is my Trip report with TripWithScience's Liquid psilocybin.So to review the whole experience I have looked around on SR2 for quality mushrooms before but not knowing much about the psilocybin game or where to look what to look for what kind of product stealth prices etc to even begin to deal with I had started to think that my psychedelic expeditions one provided by darknet endeavors were going to be constrained to LSD and DMT and a few other reputable vendors. Having only one listing up initially looked somewhat sketchy to me and thinking it may be too ""chemical"" of a drug I was weary to use Trip as a source especially for my first mushroom gig. Well Lets start out by saying that I was wrong. TripWithScience Is one of the most if not THE MOST professional and well articulated vendor I have dealt with on the Silk Road. I felt like I was conversing with a PhD who just manufactured with great care some entheogens on the side as a real passion. I ""knew"" exactly what to expect I learned a ton about psilocybin from his vendor page and the multiple references he gave for my own research purposes. To break down some particulars. Communication- 5/5    •Trip will message you when the order is placed telling you what to expect.     • If you have any questions He will answer in the utmost professional manner and clarityShipping- 5/5     •Cross country West coast to east coast took 4 days max     • I ordered one order on Sat it arrived Wednesday. One Monday. It arrived Thursday. Perfect to place order ship and receive your product all in the same weekStealth- 5/5     •Its perfect. Any potential customers literally have nothing to worry about. Ship it to your parents or grandparents house. Stealth Is some of the best I've seen (and I've seen some quality stealth)Product- 10/5    •This product is quick acting. I took two vials mixed with some orange juice that was literally squeezed right in front of me and within 10-15 minutes max I was almost breaking through to the fully psychedelic space.     • It is tasteless. Atleast mixed in with OJ. I didn't even feel like I was drinking anything. The best drug administering I have even done even compared to the easy nature of letting a tab of acid sit on your tongue. I would rather do this    • The space WAS fully psychedelic. Having not done psilocybin before I don't have anything to compare it too but it was just as psychedelic albeit a bit different than LSD. The mushrooms definitely have their own method of transporting your psychological and ego state to an elevated realm.     • The two vials I took at 5:30 pm lasted until 11pm when I started vaguely feeling like ""myself"" again. So 6-7 hours minimum of conscious enhancing slate clearing egoless existence. I really can't wait to do it again. If anyone wants to hear more about the actual trip. Feel free to message me. I walked on the beach for hours and watched the sun set and a storm come in and I felt like I was on a beach on a foreign planet as a primitive protohuman just taking in the majesty of life for the first time. It truly was breathtaking. Fully Psychedelic and worth the money.  Trip you are awesome. I hope you get some more press on here My friend.

"607",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I guess I'll get started by saying the shipping was phenomenal. It only took 3 business days (Monday Tuesday and was here by Wednesday. Ordered Sunday) to the East Coast.And the trip was amazing. I've tried LSD many times before this and the 'trippy' feeling was much stronger with the Pscilocybin.I really had a great experience while I was tripping. I thought a lot about the future and what I was going to do in life. I also thought about society and how we are overstimulated in this day and age.To be honest I didn't realize how strong it would be so it's hard for me to remember exactly what I was thinking during it. It was so new that I didn't spend as much time as I should have thinking about things.

"608",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Updated Trip Report.   A little more detail on this one:Because my first experience with the liquid was so pleasant i decided to take this one a little further. I documented the trip by keeping a timer running and evaluating my mentals as I saw fit. Also I dosed myself with DMT. several times throughout the trip.My backround with psycherdelics is vast. I have many trips via LSD SHROOMS X and DMT under my belt. While I do enjoy fun laughy happy goofy trips; I am always seeking to explore my psyche and gain insight and perspective on life. My favorite trips are intense and a bit scary but after which I emerge empowered due to the fact that I made it through A journey of the mind that so few people have the priviledge to experience.Enough about me. Here is my breakdown of my most recent experience with TripWithScience's liquid BOOMERS:Dosage was 1.5 vials roughly 3 grams on an empty stomach.The liquid form completely bypassed any type of stomach aches or ill feelings that we all know can set the tone for a bad trip. Onset of a nice body buzz accompanied by a feeling of well being was about 9 minutes. At that point I was positive that I was going to have a wonderful experience. I just knew that I was in for a nice mellow trip. And I was rigt.After 17 minutes the trip was getting harder. Great body buzz and I was simply content. Smiling from ear to ear... It was time for some soft trance music to really get the mood going. Life was good.At 34 minutes all of the same feelings are more intense. I was feeling like celebrating. The light trance had to go. I bumped up the tunes to some more intense music. ""Infected Mushroom"" if you are wondering. The faster music elevated my mood and energized me.At 55 minutes I was still feeling great. Nothing too intense but very enjoyable. It was time to throw some DMT in to the mix... .25 mg's of DMT out of the all powerful Vapor Genie. Before I exhaled I was on a whole new plain of existance. The ""WOW"" factor was in full effect. All I could do at this point was laugh and be greatful for the power of these two substances and the depth of the human mind. I wish I could explain this rush of wonder and power. For those of you who know where im coming from im sure you understand that some things just can't be described only experienced.As the DMT wound down I came back to the soft euphoric foundation of the liquid boomers. Analyzing a DMT trip under the influence of some good boomers was a first for me. And again all I can say is ""WOW."" I was back to chill mode.At 1 hour 35 minutes I was still booming. No paranoia no bad vibes only happiness. I was all smiles.I rode this out for 2 hours and 35 minutes. At this point I began to come down but it wasn't a comedown that I was used to from regular shrooms. There was no hard crash or the ""burned out"" feeling that I have gotten before.   It was nice and smooth as if it was meant to be.  And I was cool with it. I was left feeling grateful and upbeat. Its nice to know that there is a literal magic potion that can take you away from this messed up world we are living in and that upon your return you may have gained some knowlege that can make it a better place.Moving on I can't say that it was a hard wacked out crazy trip. It was not but I thouroughly enjoyed every second of it. The liquid form makes for such a clean well rounded trip. I can't wait to get some more.      TripWithScience is totally legit.   Whatever he's doing I hope he keeps it up.   Product is A1. And for all you first time trippers out there this is the way to go. The liquid boomers produce such a clean trip that the chances of having a bad experince are about 0%. Id suggest one vial 2 grams. You just can't go wrong.","psychedelics","713",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"610",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I recently ordered 4 vials and had a blast. At first liquid psilocybin seemed too good to be true: I am the type of person who needs 3.5g~ of mushrooms to have a full long-lasting trip but I am also the type of person who suffers from debilitating nausea. Psilocybin trips have always been good experiences for me (sans extreme nausea) so naturally I wanted to try Trip's product. What really sealed the deal though was Trip's attitude. Trip is easily one of the most affable vendors on the deep web and my purchase marks one of the very few times in which I was not only excited to try the product but to also interact with the vendor.The package came within 4 business days. The stealth is some of the best I've seen. I can't describe it for obvious reasons but I do feel at liberty to say that it is very witty and gave me a hearty laugh. This is what stealth should be I think because you could open this in front of anyone (even a cop) and not receive a second glance.Onto the trip! I took two vials at around 7:30. My dear friend who I have tripped with for years took a single vial at the same time. We mixed it with orange juice and both thought it tasted similar to medicine you take when you have a cold or something but nowhere near as foul as actual mushrooms or some other extracts we've had for that matter. We assumed the trip would take a while to come on considering that we had both eaten in the past hour or two but it came on within 20 minutes.We started the trip by lying on the living room floor. There was absolutely no nausea involved (though there was an 'odd' feeling in our stomachs","this was noted in Trip's copious notes about the product so we were not at all worried) and a miniscule body load. Walking felt a bit strange but it was not impossible and did not even compare to the physical idiosyncrasies brought on by other substances. Visually I felt like I was in a hyperactive 3D movie: I noticed that the blinds were flowing and the front door was popping forward at me. The patterns on the walls danced back and forth and I felt as if I was underwater. The rug was flowing beneath me and I noticed my friend was having a very warm moment with my dog who had come and sat down with us. It was very peaceful.After that we went upstairs and lied in bed. There was even more warping at this point. I remembered that I had stuffed the stealth in my desk drawer so I went over and got it to show my friend. We both had a good laugh and then we started to discuss our childhoods. This segued into a very intimate bonding experience seeing how we've been good friends since adolescence. Out of all the substances we've done together (LSD MDMA mescaline LSA et al) we've never had this strong of an experience. We discussed all of our ups and downs throughout life concluding that each others' presence was essential to us being such happy people. This is especially touching to me because both of us were never ever considered 'happy' people - not by our friends not by our families. I won't go into any further detail because breakthroughs aren't usually that interesting unless they're your own but rest assured that this was a big one. Off the top of my head I've had 6 or 7 spiritual breakthroughs during my trips and this one is high up on the list.The rest of the night was spent discussing art in the bathroom. I sat in the tub and she sat on the toilet. It wasn't very comfortable but when you're having good experiences with your friends all the discomfort and evil seems to vanish from the world.Overall I'd say my trip was very positive. Abundant euphoria fantastic visuals engaging mindset.I'd really like to thank Trip for this opportunity. Psilocybin is something I get to experience very infrequently (and with much discomfort) and I had chalked it up as something that just wasn't 'my thing.' But now I not only have the choice of partaking in psilocybin without puking my guts out I also have the opportunity to have many many more sweet moments with those close to me.Trip you've got yourself a new loyal customer! I don't see why I'd go anywhere else.","psychedelics",762,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"611",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I've been a longtime SR member but until now I've never joined the forums but now I joined and this is my first post to share my review of TWS' liquid psilocybin.  So here goes:Communication was excellent - within a short period after my order I received a confirmation message explaining shipping protocol and what to expect.  His message included a ""What I've done"" and ""What you need to do"" section explaining perfectly the process and expectations.  10/10I ordered on a Tuesday the package arrived Friday.  This was exactly as I hoped for nice and fast.  Sometimes with other vendors I end up waiting a week or more for delivery but delivery this time was fast.  Stealth was top notch even if the package was opened up and inspected I don't believe anyone would notice the true contents.  I literally giggled like a little schoolgirl when I opened it up it was so good.  10/10Now on to my trip.  I love mushrooms for the organic earthy trip they provide.  I don't mind eating them I don't mind the taste but I had found on SR some vendors who grind them into capsules and for a long time now that was my preferred method.  But these vials blow them out of the water.  Easy to dose and a fast pleasant onset.  When I take conventional shrooms I don't like waiting 45 min+ for digestion and onset and with these I took them on an empty stomach and I was feeling it within 5-10 minutes.I do not (usually) take psilocybin for recreational uses for me it is medicinal and theraputic.  I struggle with alcoholism and for anyone who is or knows an alcoholic you know how destructive it can get.  Conventional therapy is useless and the whole reason I started taking mushrooms was because on Erowid I learned that it used to be tested successfuly to treat alcoholics before the evil and corrupt US government outlawed this God given beneficial organism.  I have found that the removal of the ego coupled with the intense extra-personal self analysis which the mushrooms induces can break my addictive tendencies.  Of course it doesn't last forever but whenever I feel myself slipping back into alcoholic tendencies I can take a trip and usually wake up the next morning with the cravings broken and controlled.I like to trip at night where I can lay in bed in the dark alone with music in my headphones and just slip away into the experience.  I know a normal dose is 3.5 grams but normally I need to take between 4-5 grams for an effective trip.  I'm 6'-1"" and 190 lbs so small doses aren't enough for me.  Considering these vials contain an approximate equivalent of 2 grams this coupled with their increased potency means that I need to take two vials.  I wanted to sample just one vial to familiarize myself with the product and learn it's potency.  This night I dosed right around 9pm and went to bed.  Since I took it on an empty stomach I was feeling euphoric within 5-10 minutes.  I divide my trip into two parts - during the first part I started tripping with my music and I felt my conciousness merge with some organic entity.  It was the oddest thing I was sharing emotions and feelings with some sort of completely alien conciousness.  I experienced struggle joy and some sort of victorious celebration at the end.  It wasn't too intense but on 2 grams I've never made it this far before.The second half of my trip the music was done and I was just lying awake in bed just thinking and letting my mind go where it would.  This is the self-examination portion where I see myself from the outside.  The self-examination and spiritual sensitivity were not as intesne as on a full dose but it lasted for a few more hours and I went downstairs and watched some TV to bring myself fully down.  I fell asleep around 4 am and slept for the next 6 hours.Overall the experience was extremely clean easy and pure.  I can't wait to take the full dose next time and get the full trip experience.  The only negative was the typical gas and stomach cramps which I get on shrooms which I found to be just as annoying on the liquid shrooms as the normal ones.  As long as I can get these liquid vials though I don't ever plan on going back to conventional shrooms.  10/10","psychedelics","752",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Great visuals and pretty intense trip from one dose.Alaska's acid - Very good tabs 120ug excellent clean pure and fun acid. Blows BV's 180ug out of the water! Not even compareable. BV's house tabs were not fun and very weak. They altered your awareness slightly but the trip had no depth whatsoever. Weak as fuck! And I ordered a whole sheet. Never again hopefully this will save some people money but not buying from BV.","psychedelics","286",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I had the mayans that everyone RAVED about ate 3 and 2-3 hours in was like ""Wtf is this it?""I had some house tabs but I gave them all to my friend and he enjoyed them but his bar for quality acid is pretty low compared to mine.My experience 'bar' was with Tess's L and his is a solid 8/10 would be 10/10 but I had a problematic order or two that took him town 2 notches he's still my go-to. Two of tess's tabs felt like probably 5 mayans. When I hear others had issues with low-dosed tabs it reiterates the fact that LSD vendors either fuck up and don't dose things properly or are selectively 'saving' acid by dosing out certain orders lower than they would...in theory this could save thousands of dollars and nobody would know the difference other than a random post of ""I didn't trip hard""","psychedelics","177",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"614",NA,"vendor review - magicted - p. cubensis mushrooms","I have been meaning for a while to write a review for Magic Ted having now made a few purchases of P Cubensis mushrooms from him. Firstly starting with the service itself I have placed 4 orders with Ted and each time they have arrived to the UK within two working days. The stealth is absolute top notch (even if the package were to be opened). Last time the weight was nicely over too. Ted sends you advice on taking them and responds to messages quickly. The prices are really good compared to others I have looked at in EU. He clearly takes lots of pride in what he does and cares about his customers experiences.The main purpose for my initial order was as a search for something to help my brother with his depression and anxiety which he'd suffered from for over 20 years and was showing no sign of letting up despite heavy regiments of medication. He was drinking in excess to combat his social anxiety and getting into trouble with that and his health and well being were getting slowly worse. I had been lucky enough to experience Ayahuasca in March on a trip to Ecquador which had helped me beyond all expectation. Seeing this my brother was keen to try a similar route for his depression but mixing ayahusaca with the medication was dangerous. I had done lots of research into the use of psychedelics as therapeutic tools and suggested we try psilocybin. Ted was the vendor I picked for our first session.We took the mushrooms together (3.5g each) mixed with orange juice. They are dried and powdered and don't taste at all bad to drink with OJ. At home in a well prepared comfortable room we rolled a few spliffs while we waited for them to make their presence known! After about 40 mins things started happening. We had some giggles and just generally appreciated the shift in visual and audio acuity. The room started to feel thick with tangible energy and life and music sounded incredible. After my brother felt at ease with the sensation he took himself off to another room to be alone with the experience.When he emerged four hours later you could tell he was quite overcome with how it had gone for him. He said he'd seen with an incredible clarity how much fear penetrates every area of his life and thought processes. He said it felt like he was being lead through lessons that were very to the point but filled with kindness. He said he had cried and laughed and been flooded with an abundance of information about himself and what it meant to be human. He made peace with our mother and father who he had held a lot of anger toward since childhood.Â  In general the experience had shown him in no uncertain terms that the hard work was to come and there was no getting around that but the psilocybin had given him a crystal clear picture of the things he needed to change and to work onIn the weeks after that experience he came off his medication stopped drinking totally began exercising every day started re-building his friendships and communication with his family. His anxiety had lessened significantly and he was able to go out and socialise without the aid of vast quantities or alcohol. He has repeated his sessions every 4 - 6 weeks as it gives him fresh motivation to continue the improvements. He has now been overÂ  4 months off medication still exercising and is now able to enjoy the odd drink without it turning into blackout quantities as his social anxiety has decreased significantly!Obviously I am over the moon at this change. I feel the mushrooms have rescued him and I also feel so grateful to Ted as I kind of see him as part of this process for my brother.Aside from the benefits I have talked about above I have to also say just how lovely these mushrooms are. The physical euphoria they give me really shits all over any pills I've done in the last few years (and feels much more wholesome). The closed eye visuals are something to behold. I recently gave some to my friend who is a bit of an acid veteran but had never tried mushrooms. He was so blown away by the beauty of the experience that he says he won't go back. We took some in the garden on a sunny afternoon a couple of weekends ago with music playing birds singing and we were both lost for words for about 3 hours! Closed eye visuals beautiful swirling fractals with beautiful warm colours open eye I watched the wood grain of the floor boards marching like lines of ants and the clouds were racing by above with complex geometric 'frills' to their edges. Sound is so sharp and I hear fully formed music in my head that is amazing (and which I wish I could somehow record!). This last time I took them I felt them kicking in physically REALLY quickly. After 20 mins I start to feel them in my body and the closed eye stuff really starts to kick off at about 1 hour or so building in detail and complexity from there. 3 hours in I am always starting to get overwhelmed with how beautiful the whole thing is mentally physically visually what you can hear...Overall the sense of peace and gratitude for life brings me almost to tears at about the 3rd hour! Tissues needed whenever I do them alone and can really let go - (which by the way I highly recommend if you have not tried mushrooms alone and are curious)At about 5 hours the visuals have faded but I can still feel the lovely bodily sensation for another hour. I have a spring in my step for the next week and get about a months worth of stuff I have been meaning to do done (as well as wander round gazing at the world around me with lots of appreciation)I rate Magic Ted and his P Cubensis incredibly highly to anyone wishing to acquire them. I really can't imagine there are better or nicer vendors on SR and I thank him for some incredible experiences for myself and my brother.","psychedelics","1055",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Canada Post changes that had me worried do not seem to be affecting anyone else negatively at this point so with each passing month with no bad news from other Canadians who send down south it seems more like this may have been nothing to worry about.Why no smaller/larger listings for export?Order lettermail if you want less!  My pricing for lettermail is better because it's far safer for me.  I've resumed offering these tracked packet options for people who want larger amounts with tracking/insurance but I don't want to take on the legal risks of sending these substances for a bunch of tiny orders so 50g is my minimum for this reason.  I'm also not offering price breaks beyond my 100g prices for US orders so if you want 200g (or some MDMA and some MDA) then just order 100x2 or order up to 100g of both but do not let your total order weigh much over 200g as I would rather keep international tracked packet orders to around 50-200g for safety & profitability reasons.Also please do not place tracked packet orders to any US drop more than twice per month.  I do combined shipping so if you order 100+100g and a bunch of blotters all at once I can send them all together and that will only count for one but I don't want people to answer my new weight restrictions for export by ordering dozens of times a month as I'm trying to reduce the risk factor here and that would counteract the measures I am taking.  This is why I've also updated these listings with a fairly limited quantity and will probably only re-set that quantity once per month despite having plenty more on hand.  If you have multiple drops feel free to order to each one up to twice monthly.","psychedelics","368",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I browsed listings and made a list of about 4 vendors that would suit my needs. I then tried to find threads and reviews for the vendors and the only vendor with a very solid history was Instrument. I immediately contacted him and things have gone excellent since. He is very responsive to all messages and normally replies promptly. I also fucked up my address and sent him the wrong one. I told him and prompted sent him the new encrypted address with no problems. There are several different shipping options available which I found to be EXTREMELY convenient since I needed the LSD sooner rather than later. I payed a little extra for faster shipping and the package arrived on the exact day it was expected (only took 2 days to arrive)There was excellent stealth and it wasÂ  completely legitimate. Many precautions were taken and if anyone had tampered with the product it would've been painfully obvious.Now for the product. They were ""Visha Krishnu's 140+ Blotters."" Instrument is very honest with his product and stated in the description that the last batch was only around 105mics but I think that was definitely an understatement they were still extremely potent.So now for a TL:DRCommunciation: 10/10 (Very easy to get replies)Kindness: 10/10 (He put up with my bullshit and was very polite very professional even offered to help me out with PGP)Stealth: 10/10 (Very smart packaging looks very legitimate)Quality: 11/10 (The LSD was better than what I expected)Speed: 10/10 (Arrived exactly when planned)I highly recommend him to anyone looking for LSD in the United States and I will definitely use his services again. I have absolutely no complaints about his services everything went perfect.I just checked now and found his listings are down so he is probably adding new product.

"617",NA,"blueviking official community/review thread - 2c-b lsd blotters","Well hello everyone.I've been pretty silent all summer. Busy playing busy working... you know. I've also been eating BV LSD all summer. Rule #1 in my book is ""Never go out at night sober."" If you're trying to have fun might as well have max fun amiright?I've also jumped into 2c-b. After a 10mg ""allergy"" test (far beyond actual allergy test limits) I was a bit hesitant - it was similar to not taking enough acid and being slightly uncomforable. I sucked it up and decided on 20mg. Never looked back 2c-b is fantastic concert food and @ 15-18mg is great for bars/clubs...etc - places where if you wanna act a fool you can do so but a bit dumbed down. As far as the Xtal goes here's what I have gathered:Viking Tears (Swiss White I believe): This will have a more ""organic"" feel to it. Some people may refer to this as having a bit of a body load. The visuals -@100 are more akin to something like an average 4-ho-met dose. -@200 they are very rich and more ""one the surface"" visuals like the psychedelia is ""coating"" the world you can perceive. The visuals look angular sharp. Vibrant greens and red-violet (Mauveine at peaks) colors dominate. Blues and grays are cold feeling. Lack of light or darkness feels very fresh clean. I thought quite a but about what I needed to do opposed to things I wanted to do - introsepctive I suppose. It has a stimulant feel to the energy boost artificial akin to Adderall. The visuals tend to bend and warp at times. High White (White): This is what you imagine LSD to be like. -@150 all colors are vibrant. Your visual field is awash in electric violet yellow green blue. At times you think you see red but it most of the time seems like a shade of red-orange heavy on the red. Darkness is illuminated as the OEV's and CEV's are heavy and obvious. You are aware of your body fully but it feels godly to strecth and crack your joints/back/neck. You feel clean cleansed by the end of the trip. Energy is pumping through you but you do not feel stimmed. You can only adventure think about what you want to do next. You are light as a feather an elf darting through the woods. Biking is possible but a little bit confusing for the 4 hour peak. Your vision is impaired. I just wanted to listen to beautiful music the entire time. You are content happy joyous even. Visuals tend to be kaleidoscopic and blend together smoothly. @300 - you are in another realm. You can barely recognize the world you see before you as it is awash in the vibrant electric current of colors. You cannot speak and make any reasonable sense. Your mind is away. Your body feels like it is constantly wrapped in the perfect blanket. You are extremely contented with moving or sitting. You are a magical mystical being now. You can only be happy and you can't possibly bother yourself with silly negative thoughts. You can't even think negatively. I could not ride a bike at this dose not for about 8 hours after liftoff. Might be possible on a desterted bike path I suppose. As you come down you only know how to be comfortable. You are clean free and pure. Your mind is at peace. Food for thought: Never take less than 150ug of LSD unless you are microdosing. Feels bad man. Candyflipping: I only candyflipped with the High White @ 150ug. I was using DM5 MDA. 80mg of MDMA @ ~3 hours after ingestion of LSD adjusted to the beginning of the come-up for the LSD. If they ever needed to change the definition of the word ""bliss"" in the dictionary they would be hard pressed to find a better definition than ""MD(M)A + LSD"". You are a smooth rhythmic dancing machine. You are ony alive to dance for 5 hours. For some reason the CEV's when I'm candyflipping are always without a doubt me flying over an endless psychedleic landscape. The MDxx thrusts you forward into another dimension of space and space is where you eventually end up. Drifting past planets and stars. You're free to travel the universe.I hope BV is doing great loking forward to seeing his shop.Be safe out there planeteers.","psychedelics","731",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"619",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Summary: Great Trip with No Hangover   Last weekend my SO and I drove up to a certain national park famous for its enormous trees. I had purchased two vials of liquid psilocybin from TripWithScience and we were looking forward to putting them to good use. We each mixed a vial with iced tea and drank them around 2:30 in the afternoon. There was some mild nausea for the first half hour after that it disappeared.    My SO started to feel the effects after about 15 minutes. I started feeling it after 30 minutes. The come up was subtle and smooth. Colors around us became very vivid. The sky was the deepest blue I had ever seen and the wind blowing through the trees made it look like they were dancing. Before this I had only experienced the effects of alcohol and cannabis and this was completely different. Unlike the highs offered by these other intoxicants I felt completely clear headed and focused.   We decided to take a walk around our campground. The national park was already a beautiful place but on the psilocybin we felt like children exploring a fantasy land. I didn’t notice any visual or auditory hallucinations but the bright vivid colors and the happiness I was experiencing made me feel like a kid again. We climbed a hill full of sunlight that my SO said looked like a place the messiah would appear.   We walked for about twenty minutes but it felt like a much longer adventure. By now we were peaking so we returned to our campsite and lay down on a flat sunny rock. My SO had a conversation with a tree which apparently offered up life advice. I closed my eyes and had very clear visuals of moving through a long narrow passage with bright lights on either side of me.   After resting we took a second longer hike to a local landmark. The trail was straightforward and well-marked but we lost our way several times. Once we found ourselves in the middle of a river of pinecones. They must have been carried by a stream that had dried up leaving behind this strange pathway of pinecones. We thought it was amazing and followed it to our landmark.   After about three hours we stopped peaking. The come down was gentle. We roasted hotdogs over a campfire watched the sun set and then fell asleep in a tent under the stars. The next morning I felt a little fuzzy until I ate but suffered no hangover.   Long story short I was in a beautiful place with someone I love. I would have had a great time with or without the psilocybin but they definitely enhanced the experience. Neither I nor my SO had ever tried mushrooms so we had no tolerance. Each vial is reportedly equivalent to 2 grams of mushrooms which felt like a good starter dose. Great trip would recommend.","psychedelics","481",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"621",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","The following is a very detailed trip report about the first product ive ever purchased from Silk Road. I would like to preface this first by saying that TWS gets an A++ from me. Everything about the order process was perfect. Great friendly communication Super fast shipping speed (only 3 days to Hawaii) Perfect Stealth and great product. I should mention that my last psychedelic experience(7 grams dried shrooms) (not from TWS) was over 2 years ago & although it ended up being a great turning point in my life it was a hellish trip. I took way to much & the nausea is mostly what caused it to go bad. In short I ended up naked running around my parents house screaming believeing i was stuck in hell for eternity. I experienced extreme ego death thought loops sensory overload & ended up in the hospital. Dried shrooms are MUCH more nauseating than this liquid psilocybin. Also don't take 7 grams if its your first time on a real psychedelic. Dont take more than 2 grams ( which is about 1 vial of TWS's psilocybin) if its your first time. My friend told me that taking psychedelics is like lifting weights you have to start low and build your way up if u don't want to cause injury (bad trip). Though that trip was not related to TripWithScience's product at all I thought it was worth mentioning to give the reader an idea of my apprehension and anxiety towards psychedelics after that trip. I knew that if I tried this medicine again with a small dose though and worked my way up it could really help me get through this fear of shrooms and help me with my depression and social anxiety i had been struggling with the last couple years. If you're unsure about buying this product don't be. Let me tell you why: Friday: 1 pm: got the package from my PO BOX (only took 3 days to get to hawaii) 3:30 pm: drank half the vile (about 1 grams worth). Felt slightly nervous given my history with psychedelics. I had caffeine in my system still from work earlier that day so I decided to take a nyquil hoping it would make me more tired relaxed. I also took a bonine (anti motion sickness pill). I tried to meditate some and focus on making sure my room was clean and safe while I waited for the effects to kick in.  4:15 pm: I start to feel the warm tingling sensation slowly coming on but i was still slightly nervous so I decided to put on some energizing trap music and tried to mastrubate (because i thought it would take my mind off of the psilocybin a little.)  4:30pm: Mastrubation starts to feel amazing and the trap music is becoming much more deep and im hearing sounds in the music id never heard before. I was getting to distracted by the effects of the psilocybin coming on to finish mastrubating. I decided to drink the other half of the vile. 4:45pm: Wow. it was really starting to hit. Everything started to seem more organic colorful alive and breathing and its like I remembered I'm on this organic planet called earth. I was starting to wonder if I shouldnt have drinken the other half of the vile and that made me little nervous. I started to sense the potential for the trip to go bad and the sense of my minds ability to torture me with my thoughts. I tried to just focus on my breath and it felt so pure and expansive and pure whenever I did. I decide to wonder outside with my earbuds on and my phone playing music through them. The first song i turned on was a psybientdowntempo mix by Sephira called ""When Pixies Sleep"". Amazing mix you should definitely check out.5:00 pm: Walking around my backyard barefoot oberving my mind and how it was causing me all this anxiety and fear about the trip. I was amazed by how aware I was becoming of everything including my mind and my thoughts. It was so clear how my emotions were changing based on my thoughts. It did not feel like my mind but like THE mind. My feelings were just telling me to let go of it and just focus on my breath. My breath was feeling so huge and relaxing and pure as the cool air seemed to penetrate my entire body. My hands felt clammy and thick and my skin felt soft mushy and organic. I notice my dog feeling slightly nervous as Im pacing around my yard erratically ignoring him. I feel his emotions and tried to calm him and it felt so nice to pet him. Everything in life becomes so alive and massaging on psilocybin. 5:15pm. I decide to walk my neighborhood barefoot with my dog and my music. I felt like I needed to get out walk to prevent a bad trip. For methere is this looping feeling on psilocybin and it really helps to just go for a walk and see new sights and sounds. And there was this slightly restless feeling for me in my legs so it felt great to walk. I turn on bassnectar butterfly and my trip starts to become really good as im walking. I am becoming aware of so much. My neighbors in their houses their feelings them driving by their dogs feelings the horses feelings. I start to think to myself ""wow psychedelics are a tool to free you from the mind"" It sounds cliche and hippyish but its so true. It doesn't really feel like your mind either it feels like a collective mind (thats sick and very destructive) preventing us from experiencing life in this zenlike state. Next song I played was Carribean Heat by Ben Samples. Another amazing song but I changed it to dream machine by Mark Farina and it felt so much happier. I straightened my posture breathed deeply and focused on how massaging and good life felt. It felt heavenly to drag my feet across the grass. I realized how powerful and free love is and my ego boundaries were just dissolved. I was just focusing on the person I wanted to be rather than my old self.   5:30 pm?: Wasnt really keeping track of time at this point kept walking listening to some amazing songs: (entheogenic- pagan dream machine (vibrasphere remix) selenas song (blue mix) by koan nothing is something worth doing by shpongle when shall i be free by shpongle  Life raft for a death trip by Tipper zero cult- heartbreak (suduaya remix) coconut breeze (tor.ma in dub) conscious droplets by kaminanda mos 6581 by Carbon Based Lifeforms   If u havent heard any of these songs I very highly suggest you listen to them. I planned out my music perfectly before hand i think which is important. I find that if its danceable then it very grounding where as if its really wobbly and psychedelic and doesnt have much of a beat it can kinda be overwhelming. Two of my favorite songs though were ""Meant to be"" and ""Fade Away"" by Rebelution. So Calming and Pure with perfect lyrics to guide your trip. ""Fade Away"" is all about mother earth and our relationship with her wishing it could last forever. Its a perfect song for psilocybin. Music can be VERY helpful to guide a trip. I do want to try a trip without music just meditating though. I think that could be very healing and beneficial to my ife when im not tripping. 6:30 pm?: After a life changing heavenly walk I returned to my backyard layed on the grass with my dog and listened to window seat by bassnectar. Such an awesome funny song. I was just playing with my imagination to this song imaging whatever I wanted. Had some deep philosophical thought and felt that life is One thing. The sense of Unity is amazing. You become aware of how much you personally affect life and you may feel connected with God your Soul Awareness Higher Self..Whatever you want to call it. After that I went in my room and put on some more trap/ glitch music and was dancing and headbanging like never before. Dancing is amazing on shrooms and u will feel really good at it because u r so in the zone. ""Life raft for a death trip"" by tipper is such a chill glitchy euphoric song to dance to. It seemed like dancing got my heart rate up though and decreased my trip a little  but I think i was already coming down anyways. Can anyone attest to this? 7-8 ish?: Trip slowly died down and I was kinda wishing it wouldnt. I decided not to redose and just take more the next day (i took 2 vials the next day which I will write about in another post when Im feeling up to it). Appetite didnt really come back til later that evening and I just had fruit and salad. It just felt right to start eating more organically and healthy and seemed like it would taste better. Hung out with my brother and sister and really connected with them. They noticed I was tired but I just told them I took a nyquil. It wasn't entirely a pure psilocybin experience since I took a nyquil and bonine as well but it was definitely mostly psilocybin that gave me such a great time. Hardly any nausea with the bonine. Does anyone know if bonine (dramamine) decreases the potency of your trip though? Does it make it less wobbly and warping? My trip seemed fairly wobbly and warping but I had no motion sickness (0.01% nausea maybe?).My advice for your first time solo tripper or for any tripper:  Pack lightly(water music). Dress comfortably. Trip during the day. My timing was great. Have your music prepared and easily accessible. Headphones u can access and put on easily are great(Some great cheap in ear earbuds are Sol republix Jax (40 bucks). They have a great amount of bass& sound quality and easy to put in/out of your ears). Walking barefoot is great if u can. Be in nature (absolute must). Eat healthy a couple hours before(I don't like going into a trip on a completely empty stomach). Focusing on how good it feels to breath can really help you have a good trip. Don't resist the trip at all. Be in a good clear headspace. Dont have any regrets going into your trip (show your friends and family how much you love them). And remember that psilocybin is a very powerful sacred medicine not to be taken lightly. You can always dose more but you can never take back the dosage you put in your body. TWS has the dosage perfect: 1 vial MAX for an inexperienced tripper (I am a 6'3 200 pound male).It may take 1.5-2 hrs before you start to peak. If you find yourself having an uncomfortable experience it's probably because of your mind and your thoughts. If you are unhappy with yourself and your life just focus on the person u want to be and get excited about how this drug can make you aware of everything in your life and everything thats wrong with it so that you can fix it and be the person you want to be.  if you have any questions or comments just reply and I will try to respond. If u are curious I will also post about my trip I had the next day which I took 2 vials (about 4 grams worth) on the beach. Very intense experience This is the only drug you ever need to buy off Silk Road. Trip is a perfect vendor with a perfect product and he/she is making the world a much better place.

"622",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I recieved the psilocybin on friday afternoon.  I decided to take it tomorrow because I was going camping for the weekend.  I took it around 5:00 pm on Saturday.  I mixed it with grape gatorade because when I opened it it had a strong smell that I would probably not like the taste of.  It hit me in about 10 to 15 mins.  It hit me faster compared to shrooms.  Usually when I'm on shrooms I feel more energized more flexible and agile.  I feel more interactive with nature and my environment.  However this was a little bit different.  I was in a more tranquil state and a very calm and soothing surronding.  It hit me when I was skipping rocks by the pond.  I was feeling more relaxed and I start to see that the colors got 5x more brighter.  I was skipping rocks for about 30 mins.  Later I was hanging out around the campsite.  I was just hanging out on my lawn chair looking at the clouds the trees the sky almost everything around me.  My mind wasn't acting up at all I just felt really mellow and at peace.  By the time the sunset the colors got a little bit more intesified.  However I still had the same feeling of tranquility throughout the trip.  When my friends finish setting up the fire I blankly stared at the fire for about an hour or more.  I felt like my mind wasn't even working anymore that I was just in my own world and no one could've killed my vibe.  I had a nice relaxing time.  It was similar to meditation.  I kind of want to do it again but maybe take more.  It was a pleasant experience.","psychedelics","290",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"623",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I decided to give these a try and they were definitely worth it! First of all Trip's stealth and shipping is amazing. Even if a LEO had opened the package I don't think he would suspect a thing. Overall Trip is definitely one of the most reputable vendors on the DM. I decided to try the extracts at home since I wanted a familiar environment to trip in. I prepared a playlist some papers to draw with and some snacks. I wanted to be sure that I wouldn't throw up so I fasted for the day. I mixed half of a vial in with Jones' Bubblegum soda and I was on my way. Feelings of euphoria and derealization came within 5 minutes- I was very surprised it had been that quick. After stumbling around the house in awe of this newfound sensation I quickly realized that it had made my movements very difficult. I felt sort of naseous but I think I could attribute that to having a low blood pressure from not eating. I stared at my Chaos/physics textbook and I was GONE. I felt like I had transcended beyond the Minkowski space-time continuum to another dimension. Time had practically ceased to exist and I was in my own mind. It was absolutely amazing. After thinking I was Poincare for an hour or so I decided to sketch my visions-- Everyone must do this! I think sketching on psychedelics unleashes an immense creative potential within. I saw fractals upon fractals on the walls and the world opened up to me in a spectacular array of colors These extracts were very distinct from other psychedelics I have used in the past and had a very nice afterglow. It lasted around 2-3 hours on half of a vial for me which is ideal if you want to try psychedelics for the first time. If you want to try psilocybin but can't bare the taste/naseous feelings swallowing them down look no further than Trip's liquid shroom extract solutions!","psychedelics","336",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"624",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Three friends and I went on a camping trip this last weekend up in the mountains elevating to heights above 2000 feet. The place we were exploring had hundreds of thousands of unexplored areas. We found a spot about 30 miles deep into the mountains and we made sure we were deep in the forest where solitude was certainely present.  After we set everything up that we would need we consumed our liquid. I ended up drinking a full vial the taste and method of consumption was much more convenient and easier to tolerate than the normal dried product. The effects start with warm fuzzy visuals almost as if everything in your periphirals is a hologram. There are definitely body waves often some that nearly knock you off your feet due to pleasure and a sense of happiness.  It's difficult to refrain from smiling the seconds the effects of the liquid hit you.  When you are outside completely surrounded by wilderness and no sense of establishment your trip will be improved.  I often put my face close to the ground to clearly observe plants being lifted by the earths breathing.  Fractals were occuring in the forest lush on the ground and often on the trees.  I laid on the ground and looked at the stars while listening to Neil DeGrasse Tyson talk about the universe and the stars began drastically dancing all over the night sky.  I observed a satelite soaring through space leaving traces of ripples behind its bath causing disturbances in the nearby stars. Shooting stars effected my body waves and I could almost feel the soul of every dying star. The night ended with listening to Infected Mushroom and dancing with finger LED lights next to a campfire because the traces resulting from the liquid are so vivid and euphoric. The peak of the trip lasted a good three and a half hours whilst the effects overall linger on your mentality around 7-8 hours.","psychedelics","327",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"625",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I drank one vial alone at around 10PM and it kicked in around an hour later. At first I just felt pleasantly drunk (I hadn't consumed any alcohol) and I just felt compelled to keep moving. After a few hours the drunk feeling wore off and I started having deep introspective realizations. I realized that I needed to demand respect if I wanted to receive it and that I needed to change the way I was living if I wanted to crawl out of the hole I've recently been digging. Seems simple in retrospect but those epiphanies were hidden to me and I feel like the shrooms helped me unlock a part of my conciousness that forced me to realize what I need to do to become the person that I want to be. Amongst other epiphanies that I still need to spend time thinking about. This is the first time I've done any psilocybin but it was a strange wonderful almost bizarre experience that I will be repeating in a higher dosage because I know there's still more to my mind that I need to discover. I ended the trip with a marathon pipe smoking session of tobacco staring at the night sky at about 3am in the morning. There were never really any strange visuals or hallucinations other than the sensation sometimes of there being unique colors inside of colors.","psychedelics","232",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I though at one time i had a less than stellar experience with some of the silk road prints. However at careful examination i realized that the ephedra in your system a week before aa trip can diminish greatly the lsd trip experience. I had some solid time away from the go-go juice and limted opiates and i decided to take two of the First Mayan Batch he ever had. I smoked a little dmt in a joint about 45 min in. Three hours later i was tripping balls so fucking hard i am ashamed to admit i panicked and hit the seroquel bail out cord. I finally with the help of my girl managed to calm down enough to relax and lay down for a bit. I had no idea i was going to be taken there with just two hits. He has the finest lsd around and i can tell you all that it is truly magical. Other drugs in your system do have an effect on your lsd bioavailability. Thanks BlueViking or the Mayan im Sorry and ashamed that i had to Bail three hours in but i was not really prepared to go where i went and was headed. I was with a friend and it was his first time i was supposed to be his guide and i had a tough time admitting to myself that i was overwhelmed and hated using the seroquel bail out but i was sweating profusely and having a hard time controlling my breathing and emotional state. The Mayan was so amazing it was like full blown visuals within an hour an a half then i started kind of panicking not good then i allowed myself to buck the flow instead of ride it. I sure hope i get some more of his Mayan its Truly an amazing Teacher. Is there going to be sales at any other sites for BlueViking? I miss ya bro...

"628",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","My friend and I each drank 1 vial and he got a good trip going but I only had a body high (I did LSD a week before) so I drank another. Soon I was feeling phenomenal and we were livin and lovin out loud. We were getting goofy and having a two person carnival. I remember my friend started playing guitar and we were both singing 4 Non Blondes as loud as we could with volcanic joy. In our daze we decided to drink more. He drank another half and I drank a whole (a total of 3 vials for me). This was an absolutely horrible idea. This amount was well beyond my tolerance and experience level. We also had a deleterious environment so I got spooked and crawled into a dark hallway and the bad trip began...I descended into an insane perspective of ungraspable mental torment. I did not have a memory of any prior moment with a perception different from the current one. My entire life history was fast-paced nightmare-like confusion. No one myself included physically existed. No one questioned how they got to this moment nor how they met. I was never born and I would never die. I was sentenced to an eternity of illogical interactions randomly occuring without my control. This hell was the normal and it was a fact. The only abnormal feature was my recent realization of it. Every attempt at presenting a past event to refute this new perception only confirmed the horror. Although I did not want to commit suicide it was an absolutely inevitable action for that night and it lingered at every moment like a ghost in the room. From my buddy's percpective I was sweating hard and had short convulsions. I demanded silence and darkness. Eventually I vomited and I was instantly brought back to reality.I am fully aware that what I did was idiotic and certainly was NOT a reflection of the product (other than good potency). I plan on ordering from TWS again but I hope to warn others to avoid overindulgence lest a harsh lesson will be patently learnt. Overall product and vendor review: Excellent product quality excellent visuals excellent stealth excellent shipping speed and excellent customer service.

"629",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","We used two squares on third trip and actually already knew what to expect. T+20minutes in I started to feel different and T+30minutes the laughing phase started which always occurs prior to the peak and usually lasts between 05 to 1 hour. Now before going on and describing the peak I have to give you the settings in which we were tripping: It was seaside with rocky coastline and we started about 15h before the sunset. As we reached the peak the sun was sinking into the horizon and the play of colors was triggered - it was by far the best show of colors I've ever seen - color melted together just like you can seen in art class and separated like there were no boundaries to this form of art - belive me I've tried to reverse the process in art class and failed and now that all those colors dancing before me was so fascinating new and authentic - it really felt like new perspective on the world and possibilities had opened up to me (from the very first trip I knew why tripping on acid is considered a spiritually opening or world changing trip) and everytime I've been tripping then something new has opened up to me third trip was no exception and this time what I saw was even stronger. After gazing into the sky for about an hour I started to feel the ground full of small stones and felt like I had connection with some as if we were the one and finally found one that felt like my stone it felt soft from the one side and pointy from the other unfortunately I lost that stone after 05h or so. Shortly after losing the one and only stone I started to wander along the coast and found metal pillar on the coast - half of which was in the sea and half on the ground so water could run trough it as the waves hit the shore and since the waves retreated back to see over and over again then it felt like the metal pillar was some sort of big animal like whale or something washed to the coast by sea and was there just only to take its last breaths. Everything while tripping felt so real important and fascinating as if I had the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of child to whom the world is a new place.This seller has genuine product and I'd recommend for everyone to just try it atleast once so you would learn to appreciate the world were living in. Trip ended T+9h and after that it was hard to sleep to due all the interesting thoughts that were running through my head.Sorry for all the logical and grammatical mistakes if there should be any - I wasn't able to correct anything since I wrote this with my phone.","psychedelics","487",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of the vendors we are already rating sells MDMA and all of our community uses it so let's add it to the line up.It's widely known that we opened a public forum and listing service for our star vendors. The Majestic Garden. This was done to help continue the flow of quality product to trusted vendors while the markets were in great upheaval and extremely unpredictable.Now that the markets are stable and the need for a separate or an individual outlet is no longer needed. We would like to continue to use that infrastructure of the public forum and have changed our vendor listing service into a community information hub.Unfortunately there is never a 100% way for me to say I am 1 of 2 main avengers that started this back on Silk Road 1 Forum. I will ask when any vendor that's willing to stop by here and let the community know we are the same avengers we have always been.We have our OP orientated to point to the information hub and our forum. This is done to try and give the communities from all the marketplaces a common platform to discuss current vendors and aid them in selecting the best one suited for their needs.

I have been battling treatment resistant depression for ten years and have tried it all. Drugs therapy ECT clinical trials holistic/new age stuff. Recently one of my doctors suggested ayahuasca. That seemed to change people a bit too much for my taste haha I should say according to my limited research. So I thought that I'd start with something a bit more ""beginner"". After all I had attempted to do drugs containing psilocybin twice before.I have a crazy high tolerance for everything(which could be why depression meds never work for me). I am currently taking medications but when I go off of them it doesn’t seem to change the tolerance issue.  I tried smoking marijuana a hundred times in highschool but it never did anything to me ambien barely does anything you get the idea. The first time I tried shrooms I did an 1/8th and nothing happened. The second time(though it was philosopher stone) I just kept eating and eating all night until I had eaten the whole ounce that I had. In the end I just felt a little stoned. Trip Report:I ordered three vials from TWS. Took one nothing took another nothing and then I took the last. I eventually felt a bit stoned  colors may have been a bit brighter but that’s it. Anyway the next morning I ordered 10(+ 1). I wanted to give a few to some friends(that never happened) mainly because they had been talking shit about the dark markets(without even looking at them) and also this product seems awesome lolThe Action:They arrived! That night I downed three on an empty stomach waited an hour nothing. Took one more waited an hour feeling a bit stoned. So I downed three more that’s when things started to get interesting. I started it off by watching some Kpop videos. I figured hot girls fast cuts and bright colors…win. Some of the colors were brighter but I still wasn’t really getting a whole lot. So I took two more I lost track of time at this point I’m not sure how long it had been since my last dose. An hour? Oh and I encourage everyone to watch Gangnam Style while on shrooms it’s awesome haha. Eventually I took the remaining twoNow it really started to kick in. My mind was now going nuts it was really hard to focus on things. I was chatting with a couple people on facebook and I found it almost impossible to read their message and type a response. I’d start to read….I don’t know the process would break down after that haha. At this point I started to get really anxious. I see what people mean when they say that it amplifies how you already feel. I was somewhat anxious when I started but wasn’t even consciously aware of it at the time. My mouth started to get really dry and I started to sweat a lot. I started drinking tons of water in fear of becoming dehydrated. I think I was having a bad trip but I had prepared myself for this. I was aware that it would pass so it didn’t really seem like a big deal. I definitely wasn’t having fun though. Every time I started a video in hopes of enjoying it I would immediately get bored and think “this other video will give me better visuals”. So I’d skip to another and think the same thing repeating the process over and over. Eventually one of my friends on FB caught onto the fact that I was having a bad trip and told me that a walk would help. BIG MISTAKE. The second that I stepped outside I was immediately scared to death of being arrested(not sure why I didn’t just go back inside). I live in a Midwestern suburb everyone is in bed by 10(besides me) and no one is ever walking around at night. The whole time I knew that I was being paranoid but it didn’t matter. Logic fighting emotion you know.  Time was moving SO slow it was 1 something forever.  So I just walked into the nearest forest to hide and called a friend to have him pick me up and drive me to my house. He told me that I was the only one that was worried about the fact that I was high and that I only needed to walk a short distance. I was much better after that still nervous though. I had a lot of trouble making it home. When I would look down the street I recognized both sides of the street but they seemed to be from different streets. As in I’m looking at what I think is north the right side looks like the street that goes north but the left side looks like the street that goes south but I made it home. EVERYTHING felt impossible I had trouble doing everything. Even lying down and just getting my laptop situated was infuriatingly difficult. I gave up. I put Martyrs(great movie) on people seemed to have no eyeballs only openings and multiple noses ect. I started to feel better at this point. I then fell half asleep. I had a bunch of weird half dream like thoughts which I can’t put into words. Then what I was looking for in the first place happened. I started to have some introspective thoughts ect. Then I fell asleep that’s about it! TWS helped me through the whole process and has had great customer service. I don’t have a lot of experience but the product seems great.

"633",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Just posting that I have my order in.  All I can say is the response I got back was the longest vendor response from anyone I've ordered from AND probably generally the ONLY one.I'll just state here that the response one gets includes basic instructions where in the regions it's coming from and roughly how long to expect such until delivery.  Basically enough where you know it will come because if it doesn't the package definitely got damaged/destroyed in transit along the way (even if the product doesn't get damaged in any way if the box got knocked up good enough there's a liklihood you won't get it...or get it many moons later).I've done a couple semi-mild trips on nBOME's before as a bit of a test so to speak (they were very cheap) so at least I have an idea of what to possibly expect.  Ordered 2 vials to start where I can kick one let it run for a while then take the 2nd for a longer trip session or hold off and take that one at a diff. time.  Hey if all goes well I'll have a trip review later and definitely be back for more!Funny because I saw on Agora another vendor selling supposed liquid shroom that can be smoked in a pen essentially....not sure how much of an effect (milder for longer or something?) one can get off of that but I haven't gotten them yet to test and the vendor apparently is on vacation.....not good.  Wait and see there I guess....","psychedelics","257",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"635",NA,"top_gear_uk lsd review thread","Hi guys i just wanted to make this review for this vendor its my first time on SR i can only post in this section. English is not my native language so please excuse me.So i've ordered 3 hits of LSD containing 185 ug each from Top_Gear_UK also it was my the very first time with psychedelics.The order came within a month to Russia was quite long but cant blame the vendor as he shipped it the next day.So i've received the envelope LSD was carefully hidden within in a vacuum sealed bag.I've opened it up and took 1 hit of LSD under my tongue.So here's my trip report:16.30: i've taken the blotter held the blotter under my tongue for about 20 minutes then chewed it and swallowed the saliva. 17.30 I did not not notice anything within the hour just... from now on i started noticing that colour are more vivid i was listening to music and it felt like the music was slowing down or just like if it was in a distant room.18.00 I felt like my body is full of energy feeling of euphoria it was so intense i've never felt so blissful. A few hallucinates started to appear i was talking to my GF on skype and noticed that her picture was changing i saw her pulling her hair smiling etc.19.00 it was like that untill 19.00 from when... i realised that LSD hit me so hard i lost grasp of the reality the sounds were like... the distant sounds appeared like if they were close and vise versa. I couldnt really focus anymore all i've seen was like a slideshow... i remember walking out of my room and the next moment i realise i was taking a bath. I've seen drops go down with the painting on my walls i was like in a dream i tried to wash my face up with cold water but didnt really help. i completely fell out of the reality. i did not know for how long i was in the bathroom i've lost the sense of time every moment was like a minute. So that was the ""peak"" and from then it was... well i tripped to about 23.00 still had hallucinates but i was able to control myself. After it ended i felt... rested. Completely calm refreshed. Later on a week passed and i've done a hit of NBOMe and it was... well just nowhere near. Instead of opening my mind it had an intercourse with it. Overall i am really satisfied with the quality of LSD it was obviously genuine and 185 ug was just enough for me to have strong effects. I recommend this seller to everyone the prices are reasonable the quality is marvelous shipping is fast and the stealth is good.","psychedelics","469",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"636",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","First off I want to say thank you trip! For giving me the opportunity to have this amazing experience.Here is my trip report.  To clarify some things before hand. We both drank two vials. Neither of us had eaten in the last 24 hours.Drinking it was more spur of the moment than planned.I put more effort into this than I did any essay in all of my highschool career. Although I don't belive I have writen anything more than a thank you letter since. I hope I remembered enough of my writing classes to make this ledgible.   There was a small change of plans and we weren't able to go hiking as we had hoped to. My friend couldn't make it so the only people who would be doing the Psilocybin would be my brother and me. It was our first time trying psychedelic drugs but we threw caution to the wind. Perhaps a poor decision but in the moment it just felt right.   We got a shot glass and some orange juice. We both took two shots of orange juice each shot was mixed with a vial of Trips Psilocybin. cleaned the vials out with orange juice and drank that as well. Just to be sure we got it all. We got a bit giddy here. Knowing we couldn't go back at this point. We thought we had a basic idea of what we were getting ourselves into. Even though that was totally wrong it helped us relax.  We laid back on my bed and just watched the ceiling. We have this ""popcorn"" ceiling that can be pretty trippy to look at all by itself. A few minutes past like this before we started to feel a little nauseous. It wasn't that bad and it passed in just a couple of minutes. Then things got weird!   When I say weird I mean it in the best of ways. I started to see shapes and moving figures in the ceiling. It was so very interesting I also got this incredible warm feeling. A feeling of happiness and joy. Suddenly neither of us could stop laughing. We werent sure why. However it was absolutely fantastic. Then one of us got the brilliant idea to sit up. When we did it was like a whole other world. A new feeling and everything looked so different. It was a little overwhelming so we laid back down for a minute.   Once we decided we had to get up and explore this other world we saw when we sat up things got even better! We crawled around the room a little looking at every little thing! everything was so amazing! I couldn't tell you why it was it just was. Eventually we decided to explore the rest of the house. Boy was that exiting! Everywhere we looked there were little worlds that we would have never noticed before. Every world had its on feeling to it and its on reasons for looking incredible. We wandered all around the house for maybe 30 minutes laughing and loving everything!  Then my grandfather whom me and my brother live with got home. Que dramatic music. He would surly not approve of our behavior. So we headed back to my room and tried to settle our laughter (he always says hello when he gets home from his walks.) We managed to act in a proper way for long enough for him to move on to his own things.   At this point we wanted very badly to head outside. Only problem was my brother couldn't find socks. It was warm enough out and he was probably going to wear sandals regardless but to us at the time he NEEDED socks. It was all very hilarious once we realized he didn't really need socks. Eventually we managed to get ourselves out the door.   The outside world was a wonderland to be explored I felt like a kid again. Energetic running around just wanting to play. We headed down to the creek on the edge of my grandfather's property because it is pretty nice all on its own. But man had I never seen anything more beautiful. I got down and dunked my head in the water. It was maybe 70F out but it felt so wonderful. We tossed rocks into the stream it was all so fantastic.    I don't know how much time passed before we decided to sit down on the rocky shore. This is where everything started to get really intense for me at least. I sat there on the edge of the creek with my little brother and we talked. I couldn't tell you what we talked about. It felt like we talked forever. Like we sat there forever. It felt like a true eternity. It wasn't negative in any way but what came from it was a little scary.    During that eternity I had lost everything that had made me me. All of my experiences all of my memories my previous thoughts ideals and beliefs. All of it was just gone I had forgotten it over the ages. Until a spark of it came back I remembered a house a big peach house. I didn't know if it really existed or if this was just something I had imagined. I was so curious I made my brother get up. And I ran over to where I believed to house to be. Sure enough it was there. This shattered my world. All of the world I knew. It was only a tiny fraction of what was real.    I had believed the only things in this world were me my brother and that creek. Until just now when years of lost memories began flooding back into my head. I couldn't sort through them all at first. They didn't feel like my memories but like someone elses that had been given to me.    We went back to the house. Headed to my brother's room to say hi to his ferret. This wasn't what was going through my mind however. All I could think about were the memories that had come back to me. I still didn't fully believe them to be real. Even after the proof of the house and the cars in the driveway. Was this stuff really here. Could I be dreaming. I decided I couldn't denie the evidence and tried to convice my self it must be real. So I calmed down a little and began to go through the new memories I had been given.    I felt so subjective. It was the strangest thing I have ever felt. I had no bias as I looked through these memories. Decisions I had made places I had been people I had met I developed completely different opinions about these things because my old one just didn't make any sense to me.    The best way I can describe it is. Imagine you had lived your whole life just as you have. Then one day you wake up to find you never were a human living on earth that was all just a dream. You were actually an alien living on another planet. Imagine your mind being flooded by these alien memories. They made no sense but you try to sort through them and understand them because they are yours. Just trying to put it into perspective. I don't know how to really describe what I went through.It was just so insane and unbelievable.    As my brother and I were coming out of the trip and were sharing things we felt and what had happened I  could hardly keep myself from crying. Because I could finally see for certain that the memories were mine and they were all real they had all happened.    This was the most humbling experience of my life. I can't even begin to describe how it has changed me. I will never be the same and it is for the better. Trip you are doing something amazing here. Please keep it up for a long time.","psychedelics","1350",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"637",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","This post is probably going to be quite long but my first psychedelic experience was amazing. I took this drug mainly as a scientific/spiritual experiment.  I've had friends tell me that ""shrooms"" makes you silly/laugh at everything and lose a sense of time. None of this happened with me but maybe because of my setting.  The only drug I've ever done before was a couple of ecstasy pills at a rave... and THAT was awesome.  Not sure that I'll ever do that again since I've learned more about it now but that's besides the point.I was hanging out with a girl at my place when I decided to try this liquid psilocybin.  She was over to ""babysit"" me as I didn't know what to expect with this drug.  She was drinking alcohol as I ingested 1 whole bottle of the psilocybin with a bit of cranberry juice. Mmmm.  Let's call this Time 0 (T0) (T hour.minute) for reference. I didn't have any alcohol at all.We were sitting/laying in bed watching TV and I was kinda leaning back up against the wall with my head tilted back chatting and trying to note all the effects I was feeling as the drug was supposed to be coming on. I had a pen and paper next to me the entire time. What you read below is a paraphrase of what I wrote down while tripping or a direct quote if there are quotation marks.T0.20 - 20 minutes into it I lifted my head up and felt the first effect like I fell towards the TV.  Pretty cool feeling.  Then I noticed the movie tiles on Netflix were slightly moving.  I looked at my bedroom door and it appeared to be swelling in and out. ""I feel heavy and tingly.  Slight shakes"".  By shakes I was referring to when your muscles kind of tremor when your cold or very anxious.  I wasn't cold... maybe I was anxious. ""Hair is tingly"".  My hair felt good kind of like when I was rolling on E but not AS good as E.T0.35 - ""Colors become more vivid. Very shaky feeling"".T0.39 - ""6 panel door is moving pretty good."" T0.47 - ""Feel like I need to grab onto people like at [the rave]"".  I'm not sure how to describe this but it was exactly like how I felt at the rave when I rolled for the first time.  At the rave I couldn't let go of my friend's shoulder. If I did I felt alone and unsure.  While coming up on psilocybin I felt the same need to be physically connected with somebody but I fought against it and stayed by myself even though my female friend was right next to me in bed.T0.50 - ""Words are moving on this paper. I forget to breathe."" Breathing was almost not a subconscious activity anymore. It was an interesting feeling.T1.00 - ""Took another half vial. Maybe a mistake as its coming on harder every few minutes. Everything on the paper is moving.""  By this time my friend was pretty drunk.  By me telling her how I was feeling it made her want to try it too.  I gave her half a bottle and I took the other half.  She was pretty wasted on a few shots of liquor and a few cans of beer and she's a small chick too (110 lbs).  I read that mixing alcohol and shrooms is a sure way to give you a bad trip but she wanted to try it so we did!T1.28 - ""Definitely there.""  I was feeling very good at this point. Colors off the TV lit up the entire room and closing my eyes was amazing.  I went to places that were spacious and voluminous at first... Think of an empty swimming pool with lots of curves and smooth fluid walls or a shower.  When I say ""I went to places"" (for those that have never done this drug) I mean I closed my eyes and saw things as if my eyes were open and I was spiritually there.  I'd really like to expand on this further with future trip experiences but after my first time I do believe that I am exploring my consciousness in my own mind.At this point the girl with me was freaking out about the sensations of the drug coming on.  She said she couldn't feel her feet that she thought she was paralyzed from the waist down.  I thought oh shit. She's going to have a bad trip. What do I do?  I told her we are going for a walk... so we went outside with the goal of making it to the community swimming pool.  She said she felt all tingly and wasn't sure what was happening... probably due to the fact that she was hammered and didn't know what to expect.  When we got outside this was a whole new experience for me as well.  After we made the first turn (on foot) I felt lost in a huge world and I really didn't know the way back or where we were in my neighborhood.  It was really cool.  The lights looked flushed with more of a red color than they usually do lighting up the sides of the buildings in a very interesting way.  The girl was still freaking out and she called one of our good friends and started crying asking him to come over and hang out with us. We went back to my place because I think going outside was too much for her.  We got back in bed and started watching music videos (which worked really well to take her mind off the initial effects of the drug).T2.28 - Spent awhile waching/listening to music videos and I was getting her to drink water to try to sober up a bit.  She was calmed down now and felt great from the high of the psilocybin.  I got her to accept the feelings of the drug and assured her nothing bad was going to happen to her.  I had her look at my notepad and she said ""The words on the page look soft. I can't explain it.""  I think she was just about there too... but not as far in as I was.I put on a live set video from EDC (Dash Berlin 2014 LV) to be exact and the next hour was the climax of both our trips.  Between the colourful flashing lights of the stage coming from the TV and the awesome music that we both really enjoyed this was an amazing experience.  I had amazing patterns/visuals when I closed my eyes... like crazy stuff I can't even explain. Such complex geometry that I can't even imagine it right now.  Between that and the flashing lights from the TV and the patterns with my eyes closed... the visuals were amazing.  My friend said at this time she was feeling amazing too... tingly all over (I didn't feel that way but I did take 3x as much as her and didn't have alcohol).And now here's the best place I ""visited"" (I feel like this was the ultimate height of my experience.  I wrote ""The backs of my eyelids look crazy."" And here's where I went.Imagine being inside an environment much like the inside of a sponge. Very porous with holes that lead to more holes and whatnot.  The holes would spawn more holes inside of each other for a little while.  The color was an eerie looking greenish/grey.  Then ""there were teeth inside the openings of the holes"".  This kinda freaked me out but I wanted to stay there and explore more.  (To get out of that place I would have just had to open my eyes).  I stayed there and tried to slow the constant expanding and generation of the holes to have a solid place to explore instead of it constantly changing.  I began seeing red eyes inside the holes now and those eventually emerged to see small black human-like creatures inside the holes as well... Kinda like beings inside of a cave.  I successfully got the expansion of the holes to stop but as I gained control of my mind everything went away.  Then I wrote ""Trying to go back there now.""  I never made it back there.Another very cool thing I'd like to note was another feeling I've never felt before.  I was on my bed with my arm sticking out over the side of the bed and I think a leg was doing the same thing too.  I did not feel anything supporting me at all. No pillows bed blankets.. nothing. I felt alone and like I was floating somewhere.  Not sure where I was at but it was a very cool feeling.T3.26 - ""Mind effects wearing off. Visual effects still there.""  Patterns were beginning to degrade and become less clear when my eyes were closed.  Things were still moving though when my eyes were open.  Maybe I was just getting tired since this was really late.T3.44 - I vomited.  That was about the end... nearly a 4 hour experience.  In summary: I felt like I was at absolute peace. And even though this female friend of mine is just that - a friend and nothing more - we grew much closer and bonded immensely.  She told me I was just laying there with my eyes closed and a slight smile on my face.  Occasionally we'd open our eyes and look at each other while laying side by side with that peaceful smile... and it was just so serene.Best night in a long time.  It was amazing.  I hope you guys find this very long review interesting and helpful and I hope you guys can have an experience equal to or better than mine. ","psychedelics","1630",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But at the same time I've never experienced a large dose on this particular xtal my last high dose was with 900ug of Tessellated's WoW. That xtal allowed me a lot of mental clarity even while tripping balls like that so handling higher doses wasn't too much of a challenge.

"639",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Okay So friends the following is my Trip report with TripWithScience's Liquid psilocybin.So to review the whole experience I have looked around on SR2 for quality mushrooms before but not knowing much about the psilocybin game or where to look what to look for what kind of product stealth prices etc to even begin to deal with I had started to think that my psychedelic expeditions one provided by darknet endeavors were going to be constrained to LSD and DMT and a few other reputable vendors. Having only one listing up initially looked somewhat sketchy to me and thinking it may be too ""chemical"" of a drug I was weary to use Trip as a source especially for my first mushroom gig. Well Lets start out by saying that I was wrong. TripWithScience Is one of the most if not THE MOST professional and well articulated vendor I have dealt with on the Silk Road. I felt like I was conversing with a PhD who just manufactured with great care some entheogens on the side as a real passion. I ""knew"" exactly what to expect I learned a ton about psilocybin from his vendor page and the multiple references he gave for my own research purposes.To break down some particulars.Communication- 5/5    •Trip will message you when the order is placed telling you what to expect.    • If you have any questions He will answer in the utmost professional manner and clarityShipping- 5/5     •Cross country West coast to east coast took 4 days max     • I ordered one order on Sat it arrived Wednesday. One Monday. It arrived Thursday. Perfect to place order ship and receive your product all in the same weekStealth- 5/5     •Its perfect. Any potential customers literally have nothing to worry about. Ship it to your parents or grandparents house. Stealth Is some of the best I've seen (and I've seen some quality stealth)Product- 10/5    •This product is quick acting. I took two vials mixed with some orange juice that was literally squeezed right in front of me and within 10-15 minutes max I was almost breaking through to the fully psychedelic space.    • It is tasteless. Atleast mixed in with OJ. I didn't even feel like I was drinking anything. The best drug administering I have even done even compared to the easy nature of letting a tab of acid sit on your tongue. I would rather do this    • The space WAS fully psychedelic. Having not done psilocybin before I don't have anything to compare it too but it was just as psychedelic albeit a bit different than LSD. The mushrooms definitely have their own method of transporting your psychological and ego state to an elevated realm.    • The two vials I took at 5:30 pm lasted until 11pm when I started vaguely feeling like ""myself"" again. So 6-7 hours minimum of conscious enhancing slate clearing egoless existence. I really can't wait to do it again.If anyone wants to hear more about the actual trip. Feel free to message me. I walked on the beach for hours and watched the sun set and a storm come in and I felt like I was on a beach on a foreign planet as a primitive protohuman just taking in the majesty of life for the first time. It truly was breathtaking. Fully Psychedelic and worth the money. Trip you are awesome.

"640",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","So trying these was my first ever experience with muchrooms and pretty much all psychedelics in general. I had no idea what to expect but I went in with an open mind and with a good friend to do it with.So we decide to go for a nice long hike up a mountain not very steep nice forest and then some sweet overlooks. We each take one vial then head off. His hits faster because he had a small breakfast but I started tripping about 20 mins later. Its pretty sudtle at first butÂ  I started noticing how the trees were running together and I started to get very happy. We wandered off the path and walked though the forest. I started at a tree for a good 10 minutes watching is breath and marveling at how intricate and beautiful the geometry of the bark was. I felt so incredibly at peace and one with nature.Â  When we emgerged from the overhanging trees and out onto the ridgeline farther along the trail immediately i felt my mind open up and I felt so happy I actually laughed! We looked out over the valley and I was amazed at how the hillsides were breathing and swirling together","it really felt like the whole mountain was alive! We kept going to the top where there was a tremendous view of the sourrounding area and we listened to some music and again I had some pretty intense euphoric moments where I was just laughing at how happy and amazed at the world I was. Epiphanies were coming to us left and right and we just talked for like 20 minutes about life and everything in between. I literally felt like a damn genious. After that it kind of wore off as we went back down but I felt great the rest of the day and I've been tring to carry the feeling on with me throughout the week. I felt to naturally happy and alive that I find myself feeling that way in my life now. My friend had pretty much the same experience and feels the same way too! Overall this was a fantastic product and I can't wait to try more! Not too many visuals off of one vial but hey gotta start some where! I can't imagine having a bad trip off of this.

I contacted TWS concerning dosage but didn't get a reply back","not sure what that was about. I ended up ordering one vial to test the waters.I started feeling something about 15minutes after taking it. 30 minutes in the feeling was much stronger but no visuals yet. At about 45 minutes in I decided to take a shower because that's always awesome. At this point I was starting to get a very vivid color pallet things were their normal colors but enhanced. I enjoyed my shower and went back to my room where I listened to some music. I felt like I enjoyed the music more than I would have sober. And that's pretty much the end of my trip didn't develop any visuals and overall it lasted about 2 hours. For people with natural high tolerances I'd recommend 2-3 vials. I was not able to smoke marijuana because of my job I'm sure that would have helped this trip along.After effects: After I came down my stomach felt a little upset but it wasn't too bad.","psychedelics",192,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The guy who said this stuff is what you'd expect everything LSD to be like was exactly right. It felt like such a classic and complete LSD experience. This is the best acid I've ever had. Honestly hats off to BV.I took all 4 tabs at once at around 1:30 at night after some meditation. A close friend of mine was with me she remaining sober. Within 15 minutes I felt myself coming up and at 30 mins I knew it was gonna hit me hard so I went to take a shower to keep myself grounded. Most interesting shower of my life! My bathroom is pretty trippy all on it's own but my visuals were getting real intense real fast. The whole bathroom was contorting and taking on weird perspectives the walls had a sense of an infinite dimension and the water running down on me felt like I was being cleansed by some heavenly water fall the water itself taking on a sparkling diamond look. I was afraid I was losing myself in the trip real fast and the intense body high associated with the come up gave me slight discomfort. After maybe 20 mins my friend came to check up on me and asked if I was okay. I said I don't know as I was getting overwhelmed with the intensity this trip was taking on.I finally got out the shower and joined my friend again. I had some wax and some bud to smoke but was a little apprehensive to do so thinking it might push me over the edge since I wasn't even peaking yet. This however I think only prolonged the uncomfortable come up phase. Finally I said fuck it and decided to take a small dab and test the waters. Hit the rig felt fine decided to take another dab this time a little fatter. Still felt fine... Actually feeling better... A LOT better. So I took another nice sized dab and was floating! Now I was really beginning to peak... HARD.All of the sudden everything was lighter brighter funnier. I was giving into the intensity of the trip and was LOVING it. My ego was slipping away and I was starting to feel infinite boundless. The fucking visuals were INSANE! I can't even explain it holy shit. It was such a mystical experience. I was having all these funny ass goofy thoughts mixed with deep revelations that just started coming to me and me and my friend had an intensely deep acid convo. It took me some effort to get my words out and formulate my point but I was really glad she was there to help me talk it out even if communication was difficult. But man was I tripping hard at some point we were talking about some really deep shit and my friends eyes started rolling around and out of her head lmao. At another point I was explaining a truth I was sensing but then as I was getting the sentence out I finished my point with ""because we're the most popular"" out of nowhere WHICH HAD ABSOLUTELY NO RELEVANCE TO ANYTHING AT ALL. My friend and I just started cracking up laughing. It was really spiritual enlightening fun goofy and everything good in between.While I was peaking I did record some thoughts so I could do this trip report/review here are my exact thoughts word for word while I was peaking I purposely didn't edit;Quote""Post dabs peaking hardAcid holy fucking shit.The sheer intensity of this is profoundly therapuetic.Infinite ways my mind can try to think up the craziest shit and visualize these funny/crazy/extraordinary things or when being more problematic bring up layers of thoughts that interfere with unconditional acceptance of the momen or are structured around maintaining some sense of ego identifyonly by remaining in presence/consciousness/stillness/the NowÂ  I can let these things go and they sort of unravel themselves.Interesting shit.Fucking wtf is letters and readingor forums laying sentences on acid fuck this shit lmaoI swear I tried a billion times to both make sense enjoy these fucking crazy extreme ass visuals tried toedit/correct/ fucking stay on topic all in one holy shitAcid.this is a miracle chemical the possibilities are endlessOk I'm finally over formulating words its so fucking hilarious I'm on this much acid right now lolHella good vibes tho ""I don't even know how long I was peaking for it had to have been at least like 6-8 hours felt like it was never ending.

When the sun finally came up we went out in nature and smoked. My visuals were still fucking INTENSE but I was just loving every minute of it soaking it all in.Now a funny thing happened. I had really underestimated the amount of time I would be flying high on acid because I had a job interview later that day. I was for sure still tripping balls and it didn't seem like I was coming down anytime soon. My options were to try and reschedule (possibly ruining my opportunity) or going to the interview high on acid (possibly making a complete fool out of myself). Now I KNOW I was fucked up but for some reason I felt really confident in my ability to use being on LSD to my advantage. Maybe I'm just a crazy motherfucker. So I decided to go and I went. You know what? It was as much of an acid conversation as an interview can get. The guy interviewing me immediately realized I was an ""abstract creative person"" and was impressed by the things I said in response to his questions. I was surprisingly at much more ease with the situation than I would have ever been and seemed to have been able to make very clear points. I was so proud of myself once I left the interview. It felt like such a huge accomplishment. I was really appreciating my brain on acid more than ever at this point.It was interesting to see how difficult and annoying communication was at the beginning of the peak and then how it felt much more playful and creative later in the trip.The rest of the day I was pretty much still tripping spent most of the coming down period (which was almost the entire day) driving around smoking weed with some friends had some really good sex with the same friend who was with me during most of the trip and then went out to eat some dinner which was DIVINE.All in all the trip was incredibly amazing this acid is DA BOMB. I felt like I had taken the same acid from the 60's or something. It was like I could tap into the thoughts of everyone who's ever been on LSD ever. I had thought of everything in the universe. This amazing molecule never ceases to amaze me.Bravo BV! Please keep stuff like this floating around. I am now forever loyal to our American acid.Â ","psychedelics","1211",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I quickly withdrew this team and went back to work. I will not make that same mistake as before.Such breaks will always been needed periodically with our business you witness quite a unique operation whereby we bring a direct link between production right down to a street level.This requires a whole lot more logistical management than is seen by many other vendors and is something we are continually evolving.You will see a whole new distribution network when we return as well as some exciting new products  So for now we thank you all for the time and support you have shown us.

"645",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Hey everyone. I'm a little late to the party since my trip occured a week ago but I definitely wanted to post about my experience.Taste - This was my first time with liquid mushrooms though I've had plenty dried/fresh ones. Let me say (as I'm sure everyone knows) the taste is disgusting. I mixed a half vial of liquid shrooms with about 25 mL of Red Bull and the taste was completely masked. I was pretty amazed.Onset - The first effects were noticed within 10-15 minutes of ingestion (on an empty stomach). It was just a minor body high and that ""uneasy"" feeling of impending doom lol. After about 1.5-2 hours the trip was in full effect. Trip - With only a half a vial I experienced a very intense body high and strong visual color/shadow manipulation. My fiance and I lay in the bed and listed to STS9 while our minds reverberated the beat. The high became even more noticeable upon standing when I realized that I could barely walk. Again the visual manipulation was intense. After about 3 hours I was peaking. It's hard to describe how I felt but it was definitely one of the strongest mushroom trips I've ever experienced. After 4-5 hours I started descending from the peak of the mountain and smoothly coasted into euphoria. At this point the universe became an open book with blank pages for me to fill. We laughed we cried we were ""enlightened"". At one point my fiance was rubbing her foot against what she thought was a blanket for about 30 minutes. Turns out it was our dog's paw. Needless to say we had a great time with that realization.  Every breath I took felt labored but not uncomfortable. It was almost as if I could ""feel"" the air giving life to my body. I was enveloped in warmth and happiness the entire time.Comedown - Honestly there wasn't a comedown. I came up peaked and then drifted on to a comfortable daze. There was no fear headache ""drained"" feeling etc.Side effects - This is where the liquid mushrooms really shined to me. I normally get SEVERE stomach cramps nausea insomnia and headaches from mushrooms. While I did get some minor nausea during the first 2-3 hours of the trip the other issues were non-existant. I took 1 mg of Klonopin and I fell asleep without issue. I awoke the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day. There were residual effects or lingering discomfort. Overall - This was an amazing experience that we will surely repeat. We took only half a vial to test the potency but we plan on taking at least a full one next time (on our wedding night). On top of that the stealth was great shipping was fast and the price is right. I would definitely recommend TWS and these liquid mushrooms.

It felt like very solid purity probably an A- or A. Something to note about these are that from a single tab I got the best afterglow I have ever had from LSD. A friend whom tried one a week ago said the same thing so it's an odd phenomenon. I was super mellow in a burnt out but good way. I felt no fear or anxiety just the purest of love and good intentions for everyone around me. The next day was almost as enjoyable as the trip and definitely allowed me to make some personal realizations. I just can't have an acid trip without making some sort of progress This stuff felt a little more mind-melding than the extra clean stuff ive had recently but also take into consideration that I was at a pretty wild show and didn't take care of myself food & water wise too well.

"647",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","So this was my first time taking any product off of the silk road or any drug that was harder than weed and it was one of the most interesting and amazing experiences of my life. I bought the product from Trip who had the product at my mailbox in less than a week. Fucking astounding. I took a vial and my bandmate took one in a motel room we were staying out whilst on tour planning to try and write some material while we were tripping.So me and my friend took the vials and started to wait for it to kick in. We sat on our balcony over looking the beaches of the jersey shore and awaited both the trip that would soon hit us as well as the huge electrical storm that was headed our way. About half an hour in colors began to become much more vibrant and sectioned off. I started writing poetry in my journal as the lightning seemed to surround us. Eventually we decided to transition to the bedroom with our other two sober bandmates who were watching Jerry Springer a show that has never had much of an appeal to me; however I was laughing my fucking ass off watching the ridiculous shit that went on in that show. As the trip started to reach the peak I threw on the album Merriwether Post Pavilion and closed my eyes and just let thoughts take form in my brain. I saw the Eiffel Tower wrap around the moon; I saw a pyramid slowly encapsulate my eyes as I moved further towards the tip; this part scared me as I was certain I was heading down the road towards death. After this point I do not remember much and eventually I ""woke up"" (even though I was never asleep) standing in the shower with my friend staring at his dark reflection in the motel bathroom window. Thank you so much for this opportunity Trip I will most certainly be buying more of these vials from you very very soon. Also I am supposedly getting a bonus vial for writing this trip report so if I do that's a nice bonus.If you're hesitant about taking a psychedelic drug let me tell you this: it was a milestone in my life. I am so glad I did it and I am 100% satisfied with the product as well as the vendor. So go for it!-GrassmangumP.S.

Their wasn't really a come up it was a very natural feeling. Does get a little intense at times but its easy to control. My one buddy didn't believe me that their was only 2 grams in each vial because it felt like more. We ended up going to a kegger up the street but us 3 who drank the vials stayed away from alcohol during our trip but we ended up vibing out with a bunch of people around a bonfire and it wasn't too much being around all of those people which was crazy to me and we had an awesome time just being on the mushrooms (eventually took some MDMA and nitrous whip-its lol). We all agreed it was a very clear headed high with almost no nausea. I've been tripping on a lot of LSD for the past year and a half and I have to agree that these liquid mushrooms do wonders and have changed my perception on psilocybin and as well as my friends. I would recommend any/everybody trying them. Taking a little .1 rock or so of pure MDMA is the best combo I've done yet today as well.

"649",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","This is an excellent product!! I love that I can just shoot a small vial instead of having to scarf down or snack on a bag of mushrooms to get the effect.  It's always been the one thing that I didn't like about them and is often the reason I wait for them to fall in my lap rather than go looking for them.  Having said that however I also have a little bad news to share.  This in no way reflects on the vendor or the product.  It was my own lack of foresight so I'm sharing to let other people who might consider themselves psychadelic warriors know that if you're used to tripping balls a single vial probably won't do it for you.  I woke fairly late and spent my day normally then decided to take this around 8:30 p.m.  I had been snacking all day so it took a little over an hour before I began feeling the effects.  By 10:30 p.m. I was curled up in bed listening to Enigma.  I had a mild feeling of euphoria but I wasn't getting any visuals (at least nothing so significant that it got my attention but everything did take a very mildly hazy appearance).  After lying in bed for about an hour and a half I got up for a snack then went back to bed.  Lying in bed was the most relaxed I've been in years.  There was just a general sense of well being and ultimate ""order in the universe"" that seemed to carry me into the music (which for those who don't know is a very mellow and ambient style intended to relax).  This was the most mellow psychadelic experience of my life.  There was a brief moment when if felt like my torso drifted away from my hips (almost as if accompanied by a sound resembling a bubble splitting into two or popping) but it was very pleasant and seemed to last only a moment.  I was asleep before midnight.  If I had it to do over again I would have taken 2-4 of them and likely woundn't have waited until so ""late"".  I stand behind this product and this vendor as he seems (for a first time customer) to be a solid professional and the product certainly has potential (A LOT!) in higher doses.  Thanks TWS I'll definitely be back and better prepared to endulge appropriately.","psychedelics","403",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This was the first time I had taken this much and I was scared that I had taken too much and would have a bad trip. I kept reminding myself not to fight the intoxication and to let the psilocybin completely take me over which seemed to help. An hour later I felt the best Iâve ever felt in my entire life. I felt as though I knew the truth about life on an instinctual level. I thought about my past my values and the things which are actually important in my life. Everything seemed to come into clear focus on an intellectual level. I was so grateful to be alive. This all lasted about 6 hours until I began to return to baseline consciousness.

They arrived well packaged not too stealthy but they don't need to be. They were bottled in plastic which is better than what is displayed on TwS's page unbreakable.I took one the night I received them. I was concerned they might taste bad as they smell strongly of an alcohol base (maybe ethanol) so I poured the bottle into a shot glass and topped it off with some fruit punch Vitamin Water. I shot it back and was impressed that I didn't mind the taste at all.The amazing part of this is that I felt the effects within 15 minutes! It was wild how quickly the liquid psilo kicks in. The visual effects were really great - and the existential thoughts were a part of this trip.I would recommend an experienced user to take at least 1.5 bottles in fact I would recommend at least two be taken. The trip was slightly uncomfortable because I didn't feel as though I ever reached a level that I would have liked to. Almost as if the uncomfortable stomach ache part of the trip lasted throughout. It lasted around 3 hours for me and then I was able to sleep without any problems.I was very impressed. I would recommend TwS's liquid psilo to anyone but don't make the same mistake I made of under-dosing.Enjoy!","psychedelics","239",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"652",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","So this was my first time doing anything Psilocybin and I sure am glad that I used Trip's liquid stuffs. For context this was about a week before class and my last opportunity to try the liquid psilocybin. I had been recovering from a sickness that may have affected my Trip and I also took MDMA about an hour after taking my vial. I'm about 155 lbs and only took 1 vial. So here we go.I had eaten a small sandwich about 2 - 3 hours before I took the vial (1) in a glass (12 fl oz) of V8 juice. Since I was sick I decided to just lay listen to music and let them take me wherever because this was my first psychedelic. I was watching Nat Geo Wild while I waited for the effects to kick in. I was pretty flat lined in terms of excitedness while I waited for the effects which removed most of the placebo effect that I ususally experience when taking anything. Around t+15 I was beginning to notice colors vividly. Nothing other than this.T+30 I began to feel a small amount of body ""high."" Decided to put on music and wait T+45 I started to see designs and shapes when I blinked decided to close my eyes but nothing extravagent just colors and shapes. Reopened Eyes.T+60 Began to notice the depth of which I percieved the music coming in from my headphones I could hear everything in a 3d plane in my head. I could picture where the different instruments and sound makers were placed. CEV started to become more vivid closed eyes.

MDMA is taking over nowT+180 Small amount of OEV rolling hard.T+195 Trip is defintely over. But felt amazingI would say this was a blissful experience and I will do it again.

"653",NA,"sunwu lsd review","HelloI bought a 10-strip of 150ug blotters from SunWu... I had reviewed them in another thread but thought i'd do a new thread with a formal review in the hopes that when I make my next purchase SunWu might throw in another 2 blotter tabs or something... IF NOT oh well the product is stellar and others deserve to know...So I purchased 10 blotters from SunWu 10 from Pimpit and 10 from tessellated. Well.. I'm all out of SunWu's stuff... I tried it first because it was advertised as the lowest dosage of the three...So the first trip was one on blotter just to test... It was awesome. It was everything a 150ug lsd trip should be. 2 other friends had the same dose and c'est la vie we had an awesome night. That was at the end of july around the 25/26This past weekend myself and 3 friends again dropped SunWu's blotter. I took 2 tabs one friend took 2 and the other two friends took 1 each. Now i'm all out of SunWu's blotter. Two tabs was bang-fucking-on. It was everything a 300ug lsd trip should be... The lsd is very clean... virtually no body load. The high creeps up and comes out of nowhere. All of a sudden youre just SMASHED. The afterglow is beautiful. My only regret is that i didn't buy more blotter from SunWu. I've been tripping quite often as of late and SunWu's blotter is fantastic. It's priced competitively it's clean it's visual it's ecstatic it's psychedelic it's mutha-fuckin-LSDI will buy again before SunWu takes their planned break.kindest regardsacid_barrett","psychedelics","266",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"656",NA,"pimpit 250ug lsd blotter review","OkIf anyone has been following my posts I review SunWu's blotter.... Awesome.Last week I tried sunwu tessellated and pimpit. But because i was chasing the high and taking too much LSD i assumed it was because my tolerance developed rapidly and that's why 800-900ug wasn't doing it for me (at all... i still thought that was strange but everyone seems to be in agreement about the tolerance)So anyway I gave a close friend of mine a 250ug pimpit blotter (wow). I purchased it around july 19 and received it july 25 (or around there). Received within a week. So the batch should -- i guess -- be the same as what others have been raving and drooling about. Nevertheless i used him as a guinea pig since he hasnt dropped since we dropped sunwu's blotter back in july. Over 4 weeks ago. Nevertheless he dropped it... AND NOTHING HAPPENED. It was a total dud. He couldnt catch off the blotter another friend of mine couldn't catch off his blotter and i most certainly did not catch off the blotter (but that was 1 and 2 days after a 300ug lsd trip)So: do i want to be one of the few customers who gives Pimpit a bad review. Maybe im too naive but i want to believe he has good shit. There's too many positive reviews. I'd be happy to stockpile sheets of his 250ug blotters... except they havent done anything to anyone. But my sunwu blotters have melted minds... and these pimpit blotters have touched the mouths of now a few different people who have either never done lsd or havent taken it in a month... Soooooooo what gives? I feel stupid buying more. But is it possible for the LSD to be laid unevenly? So on a sheet of a 1000 maybe a cluster of 10 20 30 or 40 tabs might be duds? It sucks that of the 10 tabs i had i only have 3 left and so far NO ONE has tripped on them? Tessellated is next on my list..... i'll have to deal with those blotters next week so my body and mind get a full reset from last week's 300ug tripkindest regardsacid_barrett","psychedelics","368",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"657",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Let me start by saying that I'm a big pot lover and this was my first time doing any kind of psychadelic so I had kind of a rough day. I took my whole vial (I'm just under 150lbs so I thought I'd be alright with the whole thing) at 3pm and all I had eaten was a bowl of cereal 5 hours earlier went in the pool and in about 30 min I started to feel a good deal of euphoria it was very relaxing and when the Beatles: Blackbird song came on I could swear the bird sounds were real but unfortunetly this was the only instance of enhanced senses and as far as visuals all I was able to get was some really nice swirling colors and shapes but only when I closed my eyes . At around the 30min mark I got out of the pool and noted on my notepad that I was feeling loose and then got into the most relaxing shower of my life. After a 10 min shower I got out and noted that I was feeling REALLY good and decided I'd watch some porn during which I hit the 1 hour mark and was deffinetly feeling the peak real hard. I'm uncertain how long I watched my porn but it eventually became apparent that I had developed a case of ""too fucked up to cum"" syndrome and then it was all downhill from there as I noted at 6pm that I was feeling shitty. For the next few hours I felt very uncomfortable exhausted but couldn't stay in one place for long really on edge and was really wishing that I had something more than just some crappy resin in my pipe. After the discomfort subsided I went out to dinner with my parents who I smoke weed with and are already aware that I'm normally high and was feeling pretty good at this point and had a really good time was very talkative and funny like how I normally am on weed all the way through the rest of the night the only problem was that I had not eaten anything about a bowl of cereal in the morning and yet still had no appetite for my favorite ribeye steak. All in all even with the super low low I'm glad that I got the opportunity to try this product and greatly appreciate what TWS does here maybe one day I'll get up the nerve to try again and maybe only do half a vial at a time.","psychedelics","428",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This drug really makes you think really quickly and everything that is happening is quick the mistake that some people do is try to ""stay in a certain mood"" or ""focus on one mindset"" if it makes sense you must learn to let go completely forget about other people around you do not think about if they're going to judge you for laying flat on the grass and closing your eyes : if you feel like doing it DO IT.I bought 3-4 lightsticks and even though it sounded stupid at first once on the drug it was amazing. We carried them around all night and the glow it produced really brought a great mood to everybody it was like we could carry a ""positive vibe"" around and could feel the energy and heat it produced.We listened to some pink floyd at first but it wasn't enough at a certain point we put on some electro and messed around with the glow sticks it was like if the toys and the music were made just for this drug..Do this in a small group with positive people that you trust think about what could make you uncomfortable before hand (or when the blotter is in your mouth) and talk about it with the others it releases the anxiety because everybody's there for you. I can say I didn't think once about anhything bad that stresses me IRL it was just a 6-7 hours intense trip followed by a smooth (but still very intertaining and funny) 5 hours where we just hung out drank a little bit talked about the night while trying to remember everything that made us laugh our asses off....Oh a swimming pool we all went in the pool then in a hot tub and it was amazing not a single time I had any stupid idea like ""breathe under water"" or ""jump off the roof"" the dosage was really perfect and my ideas were clear the whole time.. You make associations with anything and everybody understand your jokes before you even complete it it's really an amazing substance to experiment.My report probably doesn't make any sense or has no structure but I don't really mind I'm just writing everything that's coming to my mind today haha !I can say I feel no after-effects I feel really refreshed today and could do anything normally. We did it at about 5pm yesterday effects came up at around 5h45pm it was really intense (yet very manageable) for a while and from about 2am to 5am we were 100% lucid still some visual effects and ""cloudy"" feeling still the funny vibe and the positive energy around anything (but it may have been the fact that we were all tired..).I skated my way back home and put my alarm clock at 1pm slept about 6 hours and I can't say I'm feeling anything different than before I'd say I'm ""closer to people"" due to the nice social vibe that the drug was.. A babysit isn't necessary I'd even say the two people that were there ""for us"" almost disturbed the night.. If you are with intelligent lucid and not psychotic people just do it in a small group and read a lot about the substance carry the time around and be in a safe environnement like an empty house backyard out at night etc.Thanks for everybody I bought twice on silkroad and both of these purchases ended up being really amazing ! Drugs are recreationnal and I can say I'm coming back for sure if I feel like doing it again in a few months/years !PIMPIT delivery time 5/5PIMPIT quality of the product 5/5 (even though I can't really compare no real mindfuck always in control felt nothing uncomfortable physically except when I got hungry but.. I just ate and it was perfect)PIMPIT stealth 10/5 it was really funny and smart.","psychedelics","772",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I could barely move. The visuals were good and mild and everything had that beautiful glow around it.  I felt divine.  I don't know if it's due to the liquid nature of the product or because I could have consumed more but it felt like I was ""tripping"" without the heaviness of traditional psychedelic trips.  It's hard to explain.  I really really enjoyed that aspect.  We redosed 4 hours later (split a vial) and the trip returned immediately ( SO COOL ) and it was actually a bit more ""trippy"" but that could have had something to due with a stark change in our environment (hotel room). All in all it was an absolute blast! I have had trouble falling asleep after psychedelics in the past and I had absolutely no trouble this time.  I felt great the next day.  I am WITHOUT A DOUBT buying more and keeping it on hand!

"662",NA,"the official lsd vendor review","BV's LSD was amazing thank you everyone!  i got the 150ug house tabs took one the second night of a festival and had probably the best trip of my life   it was pretty subtle at first but the trip seemed to compound itself as it went.  took about 1 hr 45 min before i was feeling it but everything seems to come up slow for me.  everyone in our group was tripping although everyone had LSD from their own different sources but we were all on the same level of that soft and squishy tripping where you just want to lay somewhere and stare at lights and listen to rad music aaaand we had all that at our disposal!  my god what a beautiful night.  that was definitely one for the history books.3 nights later i intended to candyflip with BV's LSD and Tess's MDMA but i ended up tripping so hard i left out the MDMA LOL - the plan was to trip for a bit on just the LSD and then take the MDMA later on in the night.  i took a tab of the LSD and then 2 hours in i felt like i wasn't quite getting there so i tried to take another half but it was probably more like another 2/3... then all of a sudden i was TRIPPING BALLS haha.  then i got dragged to a stage blasting dubstep (which i'm not usually much for anyway) with these SUPER POWERED STROBES and i started feeling pretty icky and there was nowhere to chill there or sit down.  that part was bad but once i managed to drag my friends out of that to somewhere else we could chill with better music the night got good again though definitely not on the level of the first trip of the festival (nothing may ever be on that level really).  i was feeling so crappy for the first part of the night i was afraid if i took the MDMA things would get worse then by the time i started having a really good time everyone else was coming down so it seemed too late for the MDMA.2 of my friends ate one tab of the BV LSD along with their own on that second night and one friend ate 2 tabs of the BV LSD along with one of his own the second night. (none of them knew the dosages of their tabs)  we had all been doing at least one of shrooms/LSD/MDMA every night of camping and that was the 6th night so all of their brains were a bit fried.  the friend who ate the 2 tabs thanked me very sincerely the next afternoon and said it may have been the most fun trip of his life.  i think i'm going to order some Tess LSD now as i really want to try it (Tessflip please!) so figure i should order now and have it ready when the occasion arises as shipping time was my limit before.","psychedelics","504",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Well I decided to try it for myself and when I read the product information on TWS product listing I immediately became interested and I am forever grateful I purchased this fine product. My experience with this product was an amazing one I'll never forget. After about 30 minutes me and my friends noticed that we started to feel awesome and that the colors on the TV were different. About an hour into it I asked my friends to go in a walk outside. Now that may seem normal for most people but I'm an inside kind of guy and for some reason I hate the outdoors and everything about it. This product was able to change who I was and helped me fall in love with nature for the duration of the trip. I was running around outside laying in the grass shirtless gazing at the stars and also throwing glow sticks at my friends in my driveway. I was the happiest I've ever been in years and in those moments I felt like this is how everyone should feel. I recommend to everyone reading to try TWS's product. He is great with customer service stealth and shipping items on time with speed. His prices are fair and his product does exactly what he says it does. All vendors on SR should be like TWS.

"665",NA,"tessellated's clean and potent 200ug lsd reviews","I had thought I posted my review but for some reason it didn't post...ugh...I had planned on taking 4 hits + 150mg MDMA...needless to say I was too overwhelmed to even think about the MDMA!I am curious though whenever I have taken T's LSD (I assume it is uniform across the board for LSD not just T's) I have issues with my mouth.Quick background - I have had some issues with my mouth lately particularly a root canal that got infected and had to be re-treated. One cavity. My one doctor errantly treated me for thrush unsuccessfully. The problems ranged from extreme sensitivity in your mouth some describe it as if you scalded your mouth. They prescribe clotrimazole for this crap (overgrowth of candida) and it didn't help me because my one dentist sucked ass and after switching dentists they said oh yes you need a root canal re-treatment.I had that done and my mouth has returned to 'normal' so to speak. None of those symptoms are present any longer.BUT I had taken 4 hits labor day weekend and my mouth went haywire. It was sensitive uncomfortable and almost felt like I had those same problems as I mentioned above. The 'problems' subsided after the trip was over...so it was definitely the LSD that triggered it.My best efforts could only find that some people have their mucus membranes affected specifically increased mucus production. Some other people have said that for the first hour or so their mouth waters or feels a bit 'weird'. The only info I could find online was that due to LSD's effect on dopamine and all the crazy things it does to your body that the symptoms could obviously be explained by the LSD use.Now I don't know if this is dosage-specific because my last two trips have been 4 tabs each time.I brushed my teeth I think 3 times during the trip in a pointless effort to make the feeling go away which it didn't. A day later my mouth is fine. I know LSD caused this but I'm just sort of weirded out by it now because the unpleasant feeling in my mouth really did distract from the trip.Anyway aside from that I remember getting the initial anxiety (come up) and going upstairs to lay down about an hour or hour and a half after taking the tabs. I remember laying in bed and the room was swirling around morphing depth perception changing by the second. Little white and black spots appeared and disappeared all while I had crazy auditory hallucinations but they seemed to emanate from within me not outside - like I wasn't hearing music or a car drive by and it sounded all crazy my room was completely silent yet there was a circus of noises going on within my head...I eventually came downstairs and put on ICARUS (from Deus Ex/Michael McCann) along with Electric Sheep in 1080P on both my computer monitor and TV. MY GOD. A few different times it was like time stopped and those of you familiar with electric sheep know how it's crazy awesome patterns and I would find myself get lost within a pattern within a pattern within a pattern. I'd ""zoom out"" and just be stunned by the beauty.That's one thing that I love about LSD is that you find beauty in almost anything you look at. Instead of looking at a tree like ""oh that's a tree"" thoughts of the beginning of Earth flood through my mind how trees themselves bring forth life how they give us oxygen all that kind of stuff. That's with everything though.I put the tabs in my mouth at 650pm and I still had very very obvious OEV's at 8-9AM. At that point I needed to sleep due to a family get together so I had to take a few xanax just to end the trip. I bet without that it would've went well into 10-11AM before baseline.I got a roll scheduled for this coming weekend first one probably in 2 or 3 months I guess...can't wait!Gotta say thanks Tess for being reliable consistent and professional. I have no use for SR beyond LSD and MDMA so I only need 1 vendor...who is one of the best!","psychedelics","709",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Packaging stealth was ingenious an inconspicuous little thing showed up on my doorstep about 4 days after I placed the order.Contents were very clean looking/smelling. I poured 2 vials into a cup of chocolate milk and headed to work. About 20 minutes later pulling into my parking spot I started to feel the come up. This was the only slightly uncomfortable part of the trip as my stomach got that feeling of inertia much like riding a fast bike or roller coaster. A few minutes later the body high was on and the closed eye visuals came on. I rolled through the workday pleasantly holding in laughter at the warped faces and rainbow eyes of my coworkers. 5 hours after I drank the vials the visuals began to fade and the body trip burned off.

"668",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","For a little background I'm very experienced in LSD DMT and synthetic phenylethylamines but am only moderately experienced in psilocybin mushrooms. Psychedelics are rarely visual for me excluding DMT and high doses of LSD (which I feel largely pulls imagery from my well of DMT experiences) I find their use mostly in promoting emotional groundness sensory and performance enhancement and creative out-of-the-box thinking.I bought two vials from TWS after being burned by another vendor for whole fungi; TWS seemed very professional and trustworthy. They sent out my order very quickly and I've never been more impressed by their customer service relative to other darknet vendors. The stealth was great there's absolutely no chance anyone would find the parcel suspicious and even if they did open it there's likewise no chance they'd think the vials contained a psilocybin mushroom tinculture. I went into a wooded area by my town to drink the two vials. The comeup was very gradual and very smooth; I took them on an empty stomach but it still took as long as regular fungi to come up for me. Or it could've been sooner it's so difficult to tell because of how gradually and minutely the trip built. I drank the vials at 1PM and didn't feel sober until around midnight.The first thing I felt was my inner voice quieting down then a looser feel to my body and ego softening. While in the woods I realized that there were millions of little bugs all around me and became uncomfortable like I was out of place. I sat down on an uprooted tree gazed across its length and saw that it very much resembled a wooden man laying on its back with my sitting on its leg. I moved to sit on a nearby stump and was bitten by a (harmless) spider and a few mosquitos. Although I was legitimately flattered that the bugs thought I was so tasty I thought it'd be best to leave the area. I wandered around the woods for a while amazed at the intricacy vibrancy and diversity of plant life. After a while I sat down on a rock to rest and felt a buzzing euphoric energy in my extremities. I had closed-eyed visuals of a river of energy flowing between strange trees with eyes; when I opened my eyes I saw the ground dancing with psychedelic electricity and pieces spiraling into themselves. I met a fear that I was going to be dissolved into these fractals then quickly realized that I already had ""dissolved"" into them by simply being a part of nature and that there was nothing to worry about.I left the woods and went to a park. The greens and flowers looked so lush and vibrant in the sunlight it was extroadinarily beautiful although I felt that the world really was like that all the time but my eyes just weren't taking in enough sensory data in normal life to see like that day-to-day. I remembered reading about a Hindi arahant who took LSD several times and felt no mental effects on the basis that he devoted his life expanding his perception through his religion and was already mentally on-par with someone on LSD and wondered if I could train my perception in similar ways to be able to take in this degree of sensory data in my day-to-day life. I wandered around town for quite a while stopping at a trendy organic/vegan cafe to eat. The food and coffee were absolutely wonderful I felt like I could separate and appreciate each facet of flavor that went into the whole compilation of flavors. I went home and lied in bed listening to music which I had a similar perception to what I had with my food. I thought about my own identity and place in the world while seamlessly neutralizing my emotional demons though associative thinking. My train of thought built into what I'd consider a spiritual experience; in my mind I saw a kernel which I interprited as my soul with blocks with complex designs spiraling out from it. Each block represented a life lived or to-be lived which the designs from one block building from those of the ones before it. All the while the kernal remained static and glowing leading me to think that the soul is invincible and unchanging regardless of life circumstances. I investigated the blocks on a deeper level finding that self-perpetuated positive and negative forces build over lifetimes whereas negative circumstances beyond my control collapse like a black hole and re-emerge as similar positive circumstance in the next life; same for positive circumstances collapsing and re-emerging as negative ones. I thought to not take what positive circumstances I've been put into for granted and to utilize them as jumping points to self-perpetuate positive forces so they'll carry into my next life and to endure the negative circumstances beyond my control to not be miserable by desiring different circumstances but instead bracing myself for the opposite positive circumstance I'll meet in my next life. I felt that if I accumulated enough positive forces in this life it'd help me overpower the negative circumstances I meet in my next life. This experience was so beautiful and enlightening that I cried. I went to sleep and when I woke up the next morning I felt like my mushroom experience was a pleasant and vivid lucid dream.","psychedelics","902",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It'll make it fine through security... Hmm..."" So I did it. No problem through TSA and as soon as we started to take off I downed the half a vial while chatting with a guy I met in the seat next to me. He didn't even ask what it was. This stuff is freakin' brilliant in every way including the ingestion mechanism.Worked great for the plane ride too. Spent some time chatting with my row-mate spent some time meditating watched a movie or two... Again very energetic excellent insights and closed-eye visuals while meditating...

THE FACT I STUPIDLY DID NOT FIGURE THE WEATHER INTO THE ACCOUNT FOR THE EXPERIENCEall right here we go so i had ordered from trip and the week i awaited it slowly went by then bam saturday was finally here along with my prize now my goal was to learn more about myself and to enter a more peaceful state of mind since i was not doing so at the moment. so after looking for a place that would be nice to trip in not just any place but this time a secluded place ive always learned the hard way that anything with people always turns my trip bad immediately i walked around the entire park to find a spot not just a spot for now but a spot for any future trips as this park was truly amazing to look thru and would love to come back and explore it with a buddy(people dont believe in psychedlics where i live at unfortunately). after about an hour of looking i finally found a spot to trip and begain calming myself with the music ( i have anxiety and the constant police sirens just bugged me out to much ) and slowly slowed my heart rate and then moved to a much less trippy spot but a quiet spot. this spot was alright but i believe next time i should find a more secluded spot and trip maybe a bit earlier. anyway-8:00- i proceeded to drink the content from the thermos(being a cup it only gave me about 75% of the drink) i then sat on a bench and put on music while it proceeded to drizzle rain.8:30- by now i started to feel tingles in my body and this sense of energy and awareness flow thru out my body thru my legs thru my face thru everything even the rain touching me became a sense of tendrils that danced on my face.8:30-9:30 okay now this is where is started to pick up but at the same time go down as my body started to get cold so i started finding hard to focus on the experience to start off with i was looking at the trees and the surrounds of the flagpole nearby and i knew it started to kick in because when ever any psychedelic has started to kick in for me the tree begin to show thier trueselves now what i mean in i can look at the tree and see the deep color of the tree i can see the leaves and soon enough on the leaves i can see the eyes of the trees and how they percieve you and then i can see the form of the trees as if they are just long forgotten people that have now been stuck here for life. to start off i looked at one tree on the right of me and began to see the head of a queen that of an almost alienlike formation and i slowly watched as that form was really a dragon head that was standing under her in awe(note i watched G.O.T week ago i dont know if this influenced it or not) then i looked at the flagpole and saw the flag moving back and forth and slowly the flag began sort of a doorway to as it kept bluring and flickering infront of me while that happened i noticed light halos in my vision like flying butterflies that slowly kepy going back and forth infront of me(mind you it was raining for this could have actually been the water on my eyelashes boucing off the light around me) at this point i sat up for a bit because i had one ear in one the earphones and one ear in case someone thought to come into the area(only 2 people did) because i heard police sirens and i knew i was still in the trip though because the light were still light giant fireflies(pupil dilation etc...) now i will explain this later but i saw a red and blue light in the distance and came up with the most ridicluous scenarios as to why police would be in all white neighborhood outside of an almost 5 star park with an all white middle to upper class party going on nearby and told myself ' your not doing anything wrong your mediating your eyes look like this because of med you normally are on that park doesnt close till etc... basically chillout."" that worked and i sat right back down at this point my body is starting to warn me that i am cold but i ignore it(not knowing this would later impact the trip) not i begain to look up at the sky and this i where it really got beautiful i watched as a purple hue dragged itself across the sky and after that i saw something that i think was about me but am still trying to translate i saw a boy a boy growing big and he way doing something i could'nt tell what it was and behind him i saw his family behind him a well and then behind that i saw the boy trying to be indepandant himself but under neath that was darkness and i watched as his darkness became bigger and then overshadowed everything and this it was all gone like i never saw it after this started tremabling as my body was getting colder and colder and kept focusing in and out at this moment someone walked in with an umbrella and looked out at the landscape(unfortunately i cant handle people at all ive tried i fail and dont have sunglasses yet so i stay focused on them) lucky the person left after a few minutes but kept looking at me. when they left i looked up again and saw something beautiful that just amazed me a faceÂ  womans face of beauty and hope made itself in the cloud and once the woman knew i was looking at her she disappeared at this time i started to feel things on my body on my face but welcomed what ever it was i started getting cold so i close my eyes and omg i have to say if i was doing this in the daylight i would just be eyes closed thru out the whole trip i have never seen so much beautiful colors it like i got ejected into a paradise of magic and happiness i was surrounded by patterns of color and shapes and it was like flying i opend my eyes again thoug as i felt too cold.9:30-10:30- I started contemplating whether to leave or not as i was too cold and forced my self to indure as i sat up and got myself and began warming myself up by putting my hands in my pocket as i looked up and to the left i saw the cloud running with each other as if in a race and that made me laugh because i thought why are they running they have no where to go as i looked left i then noticed more trees and the eyes of them watching me and a saw 2 trees become one into a family of love i then looked right and saw a tree that soon became a man that was sitting in a cross legged style in had six arms as if he was teaching someone or something but i could never see past just his form(i took this as an indication that maybe i only look at the surafce of things because i am afraid of being close to anything meanwhile another person showed up and at that moment i buried myself into myself and closed my eyes to be wrapped in the colors which actually turned in a gold silky ocean and i dont know why the hell there was a spaceman there with me but i didnt care we both were flying hihg in what ever this tunnel if light was going show us as we came together towards it my body snapped me out of it with a final warning that it was too damn cold the person eventually left and i looked around somemore and looked left and saw something that really grabed my attention a cloud in the form of a person i watched the person float and then be sucked into a cloud that far away and i was just like ""no i didnt see a spirit it was a cloud chill out guy"" after that i didnt blink for the next five minutes and for that im glad for i saw something strange as i looked up i saw the giant shadowy space of night and the clouds all around and thought ""what if that is really a giant spaceship that has been watching over us this entire time and it was just cloacked"" when i thought that the giant cloud blurred and moved and i just kept looking for more for something so i looked left and saw a face like a little rabbit but i didnt want that so i looked right and this is the most introspective part for me it was like it was telling me my life in something easy first i saw a panther face and then that face became a lion the the lion became a broken lion with a half face and that broken lion slowly became a dog and then the dog became nothing and i immediately wrote that down. at this time i was just getting ready to leave when the most curious thing happened a little insect landed on my phone and i was wondering 'oh hello there how are you and the insect turned and looked right at me at the point i didnt know what it wanted so i just watched and i swear to whoever that the insect started moving to the sound of the music in my earphones and i was just like wow you enjoy yourself and i stayed on my screen for about a good ten minutes then it flew away and after that i looked up and saw a beautiful tree that when i thought about it looked like and man and woman embracing each other and i thought it was on of the most beautiful things i wanted to draw them so badly but it was too cold i could barely move. i decided it was time to go but not before i looked at the place one last time and i did and while i did i saw so much beauty that i had to tell myself to back up or else i might fall off anf hurt myself so i went back and i knew how it was when psychedelics were coming off so i told myself no this onyl last 3 hours but i could not take the cold so i tried to walk back and watched as people were walking past me and literally one guy was walking towards me and saw me and turned aroundÂ  like not knowing where to go so i was like it not that bad that a car slowed down when it saw when and that when my anxiety started to take over my heart started racing and i had to tell myself call a cab. so i wen to the train for better service and i could see that if people looked into my eyes the would immediate move out the way or speed up sp i called a cab and and waited but if people didnt see me or my eye they were fine.10:30-11pm- the cab arrives and i tell the driver where to go as i calm myself back down i put the music back in and look up outside the window at the cloud where i see my last intense image of a dog or rabbit running away from an owner or a predator and thought ""this must be a flying insect or pet with a just as free owner after that i closed my eyes one last time to see the color pool and after being in that pool came back out as the driver got me home. once i got in the home i immediately went to warm up and look at some trippy images and here the kicker these images that normally trip you out when looking at them actually look completely normal like its like i could see everything in the image so therefore i wasnt tricked by them.The next day-5am-12pm- woke up to leave for work and had this intense headache that just put me back down i literally told myself its just from the overload from the previuos day but it was still more then i had ever felt from a headache so then i called out from work(most likely going to get fired which sucks since im in a peaceful mood but no one told me to trip so late-__-) so went back to sleep woke up at 1040 still had headache went back to sleep woke up at 12-1 no headache got up and felt fine.1-3 went to clean out the thermos to find a lil bit left of coure i drank that and felt just a pleasant feeling of warmth laughter was abundant and literally when they say mundane task become fun they do i cooked food like it was a holiday and then it wore off with a 10minute headache and thats it.Overall- I have to say my experience was alright but i wanna do it right next time so even though my bland room has nothing in it i guess i will just look out the window or close my eyes for it.I do have some concerns though i am usually told the trip for shrooms is about 8 hours so i felt like i shouldnt cross this off the list as complete but i will because when i looked at the average shrooms trip bascially all this version is -the no nausea part the no come up part straight plateau and no real comedown so its good for as you dont really have to worry much on your part but i would like to experience a full 3.5g trip so i dont know if i should just get the regular shrooms or just get 2 vials from trip and do it like that but then again wont it just be a 3hour 3.5g gram trip instead of the 8 or less hoursPros-no nausea fast comeup more control(state of mindwise)good starter cons-short duration-literally i think we can all say thats not really a con based on the fact you get incredible service and your safety is put first and you can always drink half a vial to extend it.PLEASE FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR I AM NOT TO BRIGHT BUT AM TRYING TO CHANGE THAT.","psychedelics","2649",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Within a couple of minutes I down the concoction and off I go. I head upstairs where I had my computer sound system and other trip goodies ready to go with preselected albums and songs for the trip to come. Laser lights... on come up music... on and now we wait. Now just a couple of hours before I had a medium sized meal so I thought it would take a decent amount of time to come up but I was wrong about that. 8:36 and I'm feeling something!! A vibrant lovely feeling was starting to fill throughout my body. At 8:48 I was definitely off baseline... time to start to play! And at 9:15 exactly was my last journal entry of the night: ""Flowing left to right with energy. Fleming's album sounds epic!!"". At that point I had switched from my usual come up tunes and began to play John '00' Fleming's One.Hundred.Ten Wko album and oh my lord... no words can describe what happened from then onward. At that point I was shot off into what I can only describe as infinite divine beauty. I finally UNDERSTOOD psy-trance and the masterpiece that is that album just hit every chord in my body from song to song. I danced like I never had before... it was truly divine. I went from dancing at some points to sitting down and that's when the other half of the journey began. Where I went and what I witnessed in my mind's eye was truly indescribable. I would be in those realms for what seemed like sooo long yet would come back and find myself ""gone"" for only a couple of moments of physical time. This journey lasted a good couple of hours but I was not one bit worried about time during this voyage as it transcended it completely. As I began to notice myself slowly coming down I began to return back to enjoying the physical side of the experience. I packed up all the things I had setup for the trip put them away and enjoyed the tail end of the voyage on the porch upstairs pondering about many things and enjoying the beautiful summer night while gazing at the moon lit-star filled sky. It was one of the best experiences of my life and when I feel it is the right time to go on another voyage of this kind I'll be back for more!!

My room mates sat around and watched me throw the vial down straight (tastes like everclear as Trip states) and sat down on my lazy boy recliner for about 20 minutes until I realized I was on my way to another world. I told my room mates how I was feeling and out of nowhere had an uncontrollable spout of laughter (for about 5 minutes straight lol). I decided I wanted to go out back and sit on the edge of the woods line and observe nature and it's beauty. I found myself feeling overwhelmed with happiness and smiling at every bird and critter I saw! My friends all came outside and watched me while they smoked a cig. I should have you know at this point that my neighbors house is a CDC care house (for older adults with mental illness's or as we call them ""The looney's""). Well one of the looney's decided to come talk to me and let me just say that conversation was about 100% me laughing my ass off and spitting out words here and there. My friends absolutely LOVED watching this happen. I eventually found my self playing music outside dancing around in my drive way and having the best day of my life. This product is really a mind blowing experience and is EXTREMELY fun! I can not wait to order again from my man Trip! You sir have outdone yourself way to go man!

"677",NA,"lsd & mdma avengers review thread see op","pimpit LSD 250ugGave this a certified full dose whirl the past week - previously I've only dipped in with a 1/2 tab; and while that was also stellar - there was a multitude of other substances in effect (AL-LAD previous and 4-AcO-DMT+2C-B not long thereafter) this time I mostly gave a full tab my undivided attention ....mostly .... I had two 30mg capsules of alpha-methyltryptamine (αMT; doses range from 15-120) set aside to give the fiendish Indopan a looksie and see what exactly the Soviets saw in this ""antidepressant."" Also planning to investigate the mixed-consensus ranging from terrible through awesome ... comforting that I saw good things written about αMT by ""Xorkoth"" (a bluelighter) who seems to have similar reactions to long-lasting psychedelics as I do. ~~~So about 2-3h into the αMT we were feeling a really nice sense of euphoria and an eagerness to paint the forest in psychedelic storms. We each swallowed a pimpit blotter right after sunset and had a great night. It wasn't as overtly visual as say the BlueViking 277ug but it had a really serene and calm quality. Mellow but energetic -- with waves that got really thoughtful. There were some excellent visuals though and we really appreciated the near-full-moon as it casted it's light on various forest elements.I'm not the best at guessing a particular ug-figure but it definitely feels in the ""two tab"" range of ""standard street acid"" which is purportedly 100ug. With no tolerance from any other psychedelics I'm sure 1.5 would blast you into hyperspace and two blotters would be strange ...Lovely-awesome LSD! and it's interesting that they've started vending MDA eh?","psychedelics","272",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"678",NA,"topgearuk lsd tab review","hello everyone wanted to leave a review about a product i received not a long time ago. first of all its necessary to say that you can rely on this vendor pretty comfortably. even though there were some issues when i ordered (it was my first time buying from him) everything further went very smooth. its something which is missing by the most vendors over here. communication was on top delivery speed i would say shocked me it was the fastest i have ever discovered to my country (russia) considering the level of customs in my region it is unbelievable. finally i want to talk about the product. 185mcg tabs i got were definitely pure lsd quality not a single sign of bitterness and further effects were all typical for clear lsd. hope my review will help anyone.i have used the product already two times in two different doses. first time i took 1 tab. the effect started in 30-40 minutes the feeling of full relaxation and the special feeling of music. next 2 hours i was getting light visuals and started to loose the feeling of my body. the peak was in 3 hours after taking the tab. the visuals got strong i was in flow with the music. the on thing i want to notice the tabs ive taken before from other vendors seemed to be more doing job if you can understand me. talking about the topgear lsd i has the feeling you need to work more with your brain to create different kind of visuals and feelings. this lsd is most likely giving you a more controlled trip than other tabs ive taken before. i liked it after all because i prefer using my imagination to create the perfect trip. the visuals were pretty strong for one tab which is definitely a plus. i had such effect for next 2 hours it started going down approx in 5-6 hours very smoothly. talking about the down phase it was very clean without any kind of pain or discomfort my brain was totally relaxed. overall the lsd was perfect for me. 2nd time i took 2 tabs all. the effects were the same but they took in earlier in approx 15-20 after taking the tab. i would say this was my best experience atm when i took these 2 tabs. speaking of my past experience its about 2 years of taking acid in different variety of dosages last tabs were beatles 110mcg i took 4 of them constantly. these 2 tabs provided me almost the same feeling i had while taking 4 110mcg tabs. the visuals got stronger you felt the music flowing through you all visuals were very smooth and they followed your ideas perfectly. the trip was nearly 7 hours of strong visuals the control of body was still ok communication was also not a problem which i was missing while taking 4 110mcg overall 2 tabs are almost perfect for an experienced user. im still thinking of taking 3 tabs next time but still not sure. if i will take them i will leave a review on the upcoming weekend.Â ","psychedelics","525",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"679",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I'm going to try and type up most of what I could remember for this trip report. I've never done mushrooms I've got gipped into buying fake ones before eating raw mushrooms and not getting high is the worst. I've also done lsd about 5 times. So I kind of knew what I was getting into.So the day I took the vial it was pretty random. I just went over to my cousin's place and decided to take the whole vial. After about 30 minutes I started to feel relaxed and mellow. Then I just started to listen to music my senses all started to intensify gradually. I smoked a blunt and was even more relaxed then the munchies started to kick in. I ordered Chinese food within 5 minutes of them closing and got their in those same 5 minutes and my food was already done. There was magic working all over the place lol. After eating what seemed the best General Tsos chicken I've ever eaten in my life I started to feel different as if the food altered the high. This is when I actually started to trip. Throughout the whole trip I was questioning reality. Like is this really real? What is real? Etc. I started watching com truise music videos and wow it was like I was in heaven. I closed my eyes and visualized my own world. I also enviosined a couple of new ideas for some graphic design work. I was laying on a couch and started gazing at the ceiling. The ceiling had a texture to it which added this snake like thing moving through the wall as if it were under it. I knew I was tripping balls after that lol. My cousins girlfriend got home from work and started talking about stupid shit that wasn't relevant at all and made my high disturbing for a bit. After a while it started to go downhill I had a sense of feeling weird and not accepted. Which later kind of made me realize that I think about other's perception of me too much. During this strange feeling I found myself in my head really trying to confront certain problems in my life. Eventually I fell asleep quite easy. The next day I felt great and really started to analyze my trip more and see what I got out of it. For one vial the trip was more than good enough. I will definitely be ordering more soon. Don't be afraid of this ingenious solution it is something that'll definitely alter your life positively. My next time I'll definitely do 2 vials at once so things can get really weirdÂ ","psychedelics","447",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"680",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Hello Trip and all.I'd like to share my trip report with ya.I waded in the water about waste high staring downstream towards at a mass of old trees; the river hummed progressive notes for a moment as my eyes began capturing light rapidly breathing it in and creating a shutter effect. The trees began to multiply into rounded off mirrors of themselves meshing together with fluid abstraction. The details astounded me.Two hours prior to this moment I had taken one tab of very high quality LSD; thirty minutes later I had ingested a vial of Trips liquid mushrooms.I had gone camping with a group of eight friends at the most beautiful and secluded place I have ever been in nature. The spot was truly America; a wide but shallow river paralleled our campsite massive ancient trees bordering it bald eagles nests high atop their brow.  The morning of the second day four of us dropped the lsd and three of us had the liquid mushrooms. The come up was steady we all agreed and only for about a five minute period did I feel nauseus in any way but it quickly passed. The first sparks of the trip were bits of confusion accompanied with minor hallucinations mostly geometrical or tribal in nature.The second layer started to pour over me and I felt a rush of energy still fogged by confusion but cerebral either way.  We walked to the back of our campsite where a large herd of cows were making their way across the field grazing and mooing and shitting the day away. We approached carefully with childlike curiousity ""THEY'RE SO SQUARE."" I exclaimed and we all laughed. I ventured back towards the campfire feeling a bit uneasy about the cows while my friends stayed behind. Moments later they walked back to join me but with them came a calf that had obviously been just as curious about us. We in our now very confused and tripping state of mind tried to shoe him back as though he would understand us.  Another cow started to come into our campsite a much bigger one and very quickly we realized that it was the mom and that she was not fucking around.  She bucked back and forth looking as furious as a cow can express and for a moment we were all freaked right the hell out that we'd become a ridiculous statistic of cow related deaths per year.  After giving us a stern looking over and mooing to she took the calf with her out of the campsite.We imagined what she was saying to us-""Why you at the playground you ain't got no kids!"" We laughed and laughed.Laughter was the most beautiful thing of the day.We all tripped for about six hours very strongly at which point I could tell the mushrooms were winding down but the lsd was still present.  Smoking some weed kicked everything back up and we would continue to smoke and drink (champaign of all things) until nightfall laughing and reflecting on the day.The experience was different from just taking lsd; I experienced more confusion at the beginning than I normally would and my visuals were not only stronger but more symbol oriented in nature very tribal.  I had a much greater loss of time than on lsd alone and where I would typically transition into cerebral talk and introspection I instead found quiet and peace.One of the best days of my life.","psychedelics","576",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"681",NA,"lsd & mdma avengers review thread see op","****AVENGER REVIEW****One of the members did a stealth buy of FunkyUnicorn's microdots which were rated @ 250µg. Here is his review:QuoteDropped at 5:00pm in the car on the way to the concert.  This was my first microdot I ever tried.   I thought the black microdot would dissolve completely or something but in fact it’s kind of a solid little ball that doesn’t break down.  About 40 minutes later I felt the first inklings creeping over me.  No GI discomfort very easy to communicate.  The L was very crystalline visually but there was some mental mindfuck to it all.  Later during the trip I kept obsessing over problems I was having at work and would not shut up about it with my girlfriend.  She was like…”ugh!  Enough already.” No “stretch factor” to it like the GDF fluff.  The 1.5 Ohm Shiva from HoS I took a few months back (meaning 150ug + 75ug = 225ug) definitely felt stronger than this microdot and far more visual.  No fractalization no trails and the patterning was very mild.  The CEVs were extremely mild.  There was a beautiful sunset and wispy cloud coverage over the amphitheater but I think I would have appreciated the beauty equally tripping or not.  Also I think yesterday I may have even over-guesstimated the dosage to be honest.  I think I said 220-230ug yesterday but in retrospect I’d knock that down to maybe 200-220ug range.  It felt a little stronger than a single 2013 JOR/Albion Mayan. HoS’ DMT machine Elves also in the 275ug range also felt stronger than the microdot.  I still saw some patterning on surfaces (i.e.. wooden floors) after arriving back home at around 11:00 but by midnight the trip was essentially over.  I ate a few xanax to get to sleep but probably wouldn’t have needed to do so. On a scale of 1 to 10 I’d give them a 5.  Average but nothing to write home about. Just my two cents. Thank you.","psychedelics","328",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"682",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","well apparently I am an aberration but did not seem like a mushroom high at all much more like 2cb or something like that.When I do shrooms I am doing them for the inner reflection and guidance they give me. While not every time has been a eureka moment I have never done shrooms and not gotten something out of it that improved my life in some way - sometimes they are huge things other times smaller but always something.Also when I take shrooms without fail  everything always comes in waves.....I'll always be tripping but until I start to come down I get real intense waves as I am pretty sure a lot of people do and know what I am talking about.Looking for an insightful journey I drank 2 bottles of the liquid shrooms. Mixed it with some oj and was really easy barely tasted it and was kicked back watching a movie outdoors waiting for it to come on.It did start to come on fairly quickly and my 1st thoughts were fantastic here we go...I did get a bit of nausea but nothing too bad.Then I noticed something unusual - I got a very strong metallic taste in my mouth that sure seemed a lot like I got when I tried some 2cb recently. It is something that has never happened to me before when I have eaten my shrooms .Couldn't get rid of it started chewing gum did some mouthwash etc but like a synthetic it would not go away.Then I did start getting pretty stoned but nothing like any shroom trip I have had before. No waves whatsoever no insights stars did not appeal to me like they always have - but what did happen and has never happened to me before on shrooms is I got horny as hell Never getting to where I wanted to go I did watch a movie outside for a bit but I was just horny as hell and also something I have never done I ended up going in to my computer and was looking around for someone on craigslist and even posted an ad saying i was stoned and horny as hell.Of course nothing came of that but I stayed horny all night. i drank the shrooms at around 9:30 - at 2:15 I got in my car and was driving around my small town hoping to find someone to pay for a bj or something - even went into walmart hoping to find someone - something i have never done before.But I have also never been able to drive on shrooms before either as I always does to gain some knowledge about myself.Never got the giggles never had anything I experience whenÂ  I eat shrooms.While not an expert in them I have eaten shrooms maybe 17-18 times the last 2 years and this was nothing like any of those times.I'm glad I tried them 1st as I have an ex-daughter-in-law who is a severe alcholic getting ready to go into rehab and I was telling her maybe she should try shrooms as they seem to be very effective for treating alcoholism. I ordered enough to give her 2 bottles so she could gain some insight....Really happy I tried them 1st - I would sure hope I wouldn't have but if she had taken them with me and was as horny as I was who knows what would have happened and talk about regret.....I don't know guess I am an aberration but it sure seemed more like 2CB to me than shrooms.I won","t be getting anymore and will stick to what I grow or whole shrooms so I can see what I am eating....Sorry but is the truth. I know I have a low post count but to be honest I am on the old side and it always takes me 3-4 times just to get the captcha right so hate posting here.....why captchas anyway since we log in......why so freaking hard to read ones ?","psychedelics",669,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"683",NA,"lsd & mdma avengers review thread see op","Yeah Funky Unicorn I see where you're coming from. The report seems mostly quite level headed and fair but then there is an intense judgemental hammer suddenly seemingly from nowhere.5/10 is rough for what seems to be a review stating: LSD was great but compared to other LSD trips I believe dose:cost ratio can be beat by another vendor: HoS. Assuming he didn't consume all the microdots for his review he might want to say ""I should give another one a shot on a clearer head and see if my opinion changes.""This all being said if a microdot could be ""mishaped larger"" then it could also be ""mishaped smaller"" -- the chaos of mathematics goes both ways. Anyways take it with a grain of salt -- overall it's obvious you sell very good LSD at a very nice price (by the reviewers assessment his closest comparison was about $7.5 of HoS acid -- so a very minute difference really ....). It's just that the LSD avengers are a critical bunch who appreciate detailed analysis. You're point about 5/10 is really correct though it doesn't jiive with a message mostly indicating ""good acid.""","psychedelics","192",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I occasionally use a sedative/sleep-aid and wanted to clear that out of my system so that it could not nerf the trip (as I know it does with other psychedellics).This was my first time with psilocybin although it has been on my list of substances to try for a long time however I am not a fan of eating any kind of mushrooms; so when I happened across this product and saw all the positive review I thought what better way to first experience psilocybin.As an otherwise experienced psychedellics user of which I have certainly taken fairly high doses I found this product to be mild in comparison (I'm 165lbs fwiw) yet still an enjoyable experience. I fasted for the day and took the liquid with a glass of orange juice that evening as I saw TWS/others recommended. I thought it would take effect immediately but I suppose I'm an outlier because it took closer to an hour for me to start noticing the effects. I listened to music and waited getting bored. The come-up was so mild that I kept wondering when it was going to peak and ""is this all?"". I've had friends tell me that when on psilocybin mushrooms they could see sound waves and watch the walls move. All I got was some mood elevation as well as very mild visuals but more importantly a couple hours into the trip there was an enlightenment somewhat introspective change in mode of thinking (which is what I'll be back for). There was absolutely no nausea or paranoia throughout which is very important because acid usually gives me extreme anxiety to the point where I end up aborting the trip. My conclusion is that I personally need to take a higher dose of psilocybin to experience the desired effect. But one thing I can say for sure is that if I wanted to introduce someone to the world of psychedellics gently I would give them this.","psychedelics","477",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"685",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I purchased the Liq.Â  Mushrooms about two weeks ago and tried them with my friend last Friday.Trip- It was my first time tripping on shrooms ive done LSD multiple times so i was somewhat expecting a similar trip. My friend i did it with had never tripped before so I was going to help him along for his first time. We rented a campsite at a great secluded place with lots of land to walk around in which ended up being a great place to trip. At about 830 we decided to start. We tried not to eat too much throughout the day so that it would hit us pretty quick. Maybe it was because i hadnt tripped for atleast 6 months or maybe shrooms are just a lot different because this trip was a lot stronger than i expected. Reading that each vial was approx. 2 grams of shrooms i thought that it may not be strong enough to get a great trip out of it... i was totally wrong. It hit both of us within 20 minutes and it increased intensity quickly. after drinking it and walking back to our tent (about 20 minutes) we were deep in the trip. Great clear visuals and a really nice body high I immediately noted the differences i personally felt between lsd and this. This trip had a much quicker start and a much more fun energetic feel to it. I personally recommend this over lsd it was amuch shorter trip lasting about 4 and a half hours but by the end of it i was more than satisfied that it was over. IMO Lsd trips are too long especially if you start it later in the day and then you dont get any sleep and feel like shit the next day. With shrooms i fell asleep at about 1230 and had a great deep sleep waking up with a refreshed feeling ready to start the day. I got nauceous in the middle of the trip but i have a feeling it may have been my mind playing tricks on me or just the fact that i ate fast food earlier that day. The trip was exciting for both of us and all we wanted to do was walk around and go on adventures. My friend was mindblown over his first trip. Of course it was nothing that he expected a first trip never is but he had an amazing time and is definetly going to do it again. This vendor is very reliable and has a great product.","psychedelics","428",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The shipping took 5 working days and it could have taken from 5 to 10 so fast speed -Very nice stealth. Obviously can't say much about it but it won't look suspicious even if opened.-It's my first time trip so I can't tell much about the strength but I've read some descriptions about the effects on that dose and it's pretty sure it was ~150ug","not what told but still good for the price. I've taken 2g mushrooms+weed before and this was a superior level (plus the lucidity of not smoking )-I didn't need to communicate but they will reply messages sent to them pretty quickly and they are nice guys TL","DR: Good vendor fair prices.

The main reason I eat shrooms as they have never once failed to teach me something or show me something that actually either made my life better or at least gave me some insight - maybe it would be the same with any liquid shrooms probably so as I am pretty sure tripswithscience is an honest vendor but I didn;t have even a minute amount of insight.....I normally take tramadol which apparently affects me tripping with lsd etc but it has never affected me with shrooms.I was actually ""cleansing"" myself of the tramadol as I have some DOM I want to try plus want to try some moe acid so had not taken any of that in about 2 weeks which i thought would also make my shroom trip better in some way even tho the tramadol has never seem to affected it in the past.maybe it was because I was tramadol free - doubt it but who knows.All is not lost tho. I have 3 bottles left and while I don;t get the shroom experience I desired as it did make me hornier than I have been in a long time I believe i am going to try and find a female to drink a bottle with me and if anything like the last experience it will be a very fun evening in a different way lol>","psychedelics","336",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"689",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","so uh this is my review of my experience with shrooms. I was taking it by myself alone in my home and my only other experience with was with bud/hash so this is my first foot into psychadelics. so before I describe my experience I must say that when I have recieved my vial I really was super exicted to try it so I went over my head and taken kinda just took it then and there with some oj. Now before hand i did not have a empty stomach and have eaten something maybe 30 min. prior. I also had a bit of a cold/allergy thing and i had taken some nyquil and some shitty allergy meds which pretty much ruined my experience. In my defence I was pretty ignorant on the effects of shrooms and thought of it as something in the like of pot which was really dumb of me but it didn't all go to waste as even though I had incredible aches through my body and some pretty bad some stomachache My mental state went into an altogether new direction as I thought so many incredibile things and eventually when the day went to the night the cricket chirping and bird squaking It all melted together as i heard what could only be described as nature singing or something and that was pretty fucking cool. all in all I definetly want to give it another try before saying it's not for me but There was some really cool moments in between the hurt and i really didn't get to do anything in between siting on my couch trying to lay off the pain and frequent bathroom trips. so my lesson is to not be too anxious in taking it and to make sure that you are not fucked from some dumb meds or sick or some shit as shrooms seems to take a the moment you're in and expand it so make sure you're ok.","psychedelics","330",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"693",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","First off I'd like to say THANK YOU! This experience was amazing. I have plenty experience with MDMA and this was a very positive first experience.Me and a couple buddies who I had just graduated college with recently decided to give it a shot. Fasted for 16 hours to ensure this hit me hard and fast. Took a whole vial mixed with some sprite zero. I laid down and in only a few minutes I noticed some of my posters were starting to get larger and smaller very subtly and I wasn’t sure if I imagined it or not. This was probably only 5-10 minutes after ingestion. A few minutes later the dots on one of my posters started to move around and things were definitely breathing. I felt a little bit anxious but also happy and calm and very comfortable.For a while we both just laid in my room watching the visuals come on. I noticed that a wood grain desk I have was rippling and the grains of wood were folding in on themselves. Then I got up to put on some music on my computer and my desktop wallpaper formed many different sections all of which were moving through and around each other like some sort of complex machine. At this point everything I looked at had its own very unique and changing visuals. The clouds in the background of my LOTR Two Towers poster were flying by and spreading onto the walls and the orc soldiers were jumping up and down preparing for battle and Bruce Lee was getting very old and very young repetitively and drops of sweat and bruises would appear on his skin. When I closed my eyes I saw very intricate mythical creatures formed out of rainbow colored lines. They were singing the music that I was listening to and would breath fractal fire and ice and water.At this point my friend brought my black lab upstairs and we played with her for a long time. We both were sure that she was in fact some sort of ancient animal god who knew far more than we could ever imagine and we found it ironic that she relied on us for food and care despite her great wisdom which she was now revealing to us. She would change sizes and glow but her fur was the one thing that did not change textures and we called her “the only constant” and she became some sort of spiritual guide. She was made entirely out of fur and no bones so when I pet her my hands would sink into her fur and absorb her warmth.Next I sat down in the living room and looked at a book of state maps. None of the states were familiar and the lines were constantly changing so that I thought they were some kind of medieval treasure maps. Then we decided to go outside on my back porch to get some fresh air.On the porch we made some very deep philosophical realizations about humans confining themselves from nature but that nature confines us from space and even in space we would be one step away from our spiritual selves which was what actually lies at the end of the universe. The clouds formed a huge river with the white swirling into the blue and flowing by at great speeds. The grass started to grow up the side of my house and fence and my vision could zoom in and see millions of insect communities interacting with each other. Then when I looked down at the deck I had the most beautiful visual I have had.It was as if time was moving extremely fast and the wood was decaying and regenerating over and over again. I thought of it like the sands of time blowing over everything an endless cycle of regeneration. The wood would appear bright and new and then gradually change to gray and antique looking. I could see the individual particles separating from each other and swirling together and reconnecting. We moved to my front yard and I saw the trees constantly growing more complex sprouting smaller and smaller branches to form a fractal pattern. These branches would sway and twist and vibrate depending on what sort of energy was affecting them at the moment. When we went back inside and sat on my couch we discussed how we had become enlightened with the wisdom of nature and that that was what my dog knew that made her so intelligent. I felt an urge to let her outside so she could run in the grass but I knew that because of human “progress” it was unsafe to let her wonder free outside because of the roads and cars that we had built.I went and sat in the hallway and looked out the window and all of a sudden the trip stopped. Things still moved and swirled slightly but this gradually faded away and I just sat and contemplated what I had seen and learned.All of a sudden I had an overpowering urge to eat meat so we both cooked ham and pepperoni and cheese sandwiches and then sat down to watch TV. During the trip we were strongly opposed to the idea of TV so we had closed the cabinet the TV was in but now I felt mentally drained as if I had just taken the SAT so we needed some sort of thoughtless entertainment. The trip lasted from about 10:00 am – 2:00 pm. QUESTION: How much alcohol exactly is in 1 vial? Thanks again!","psychedelics","932",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Apologies if I mess anything up.Trip is an absolutely AMAZING vendor probably the best I've ever dealt with on the road. He has incredibly fast turnaround sent a very long and helpful message upon receiving my order with details about how Silk Road works and trip safety and takes his stealth seriously (I laughed out loud when I got the package very clever). Just in general a stand-up guy.Moving on to the product itself. I'm a male pretty thin (140ish pounds) currently taking precription SSRIs/anxiety medication so I expected the trip to be dulled a little bit and I have experience with LSD which I didn't particularly enjoy. I spent my trip talking to my friend through Skype as I unfortunately couldn't be with him in person.I drank one vial at 8:40 pm. The effects took about an hour to start really hitting me and lasted probably around 6 hours (there was probably a bit more but at that point I was tired enough that I wasn't really noticing them much). I didn't experience many ""trippy"" effects most likely because the medication dulled the experience but mentally they were extremely enjoyable. I was very talkative and happy and everything just seemed brighter and more positive. It's hard to really explain the experience... but it was very very worth it for what I paid.

"702",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Trip Report For TripAge: 19Weight: 123lb’s Dose: One vial (well more like 5/6’s a little leaked in transit oh well. Recovered some other vial shipped was fine.)Setting: Mostly my room alone most of the time and interacting with others the rest of the time.Prolog: First I just like to say Trip’s a really awesome vendor and I wish everyone on the markets were as equally awesome. He was very helpful and informative with a quick response time I would also like to say that he has a really lovely product that he’s clearly taken the time in crafting and also has pretty great stealth.Now to the report I was really excited when Trips package arrived so much so that I could resist taking one of the two vials that night mixing it with some blueberry pomegranate juice before doing so feeling ecstatic at the time to see what shrooms would be like never having done them before but having a fair amount of experience with LSD (and various other things) I was hypothesizing and hoping a bit haha that they would be similar to LSD but also different in their own unique way. (Essentially that it would be as awesome but also a new experience it was) I had acquired shrooms once before but upon realizing that they tasted horrible and also not thinking at the time to make a powder and create a drink from that I just gave them to someone else anyway after taking the vial and waiting to come up I went to go talk with my sister a bit about our lives and various aspects of them. After a while of talking to her I started to feel the effects at first just in my mood and body a bit then mild visuals it was around this time I bid her good night and retreated to my room where I started craving human interaction again similar to the feeling I often experience on LSD where I get very talkative laugh a lot and have a pleasant manic feeling. So I started talking to someone over Skype for a while feeling genrally wonderful and having a grand time it was also around this time that time it self seemed much slower so when 18 mins would pass that would feel like an hour and I would look at the time often and think huh only 7 mins have passed well awesome. And that was awesome when you’re having an amazing experience and time slows down seeming to stretch on to forever alas they had to go after an hour or two. This was a good thing though because now I could freely ignore my computer and just be by myself and explore. Looking around the dimmed room I looked up at the art on the walls (various wolves and other anthromophised animals) taking a set back I saw again the reason I had chosen each of them and then looking just at the wall in general I understood what people mean when they say the walls were breathing. I then went to wander around and found a nice tile pattern to stare at eventually seeing a sort of vortex the kind that people show a talk about when the comparing time to being a fabric and how things like black holes are like placing a heavy object on that fabric. Anyway I wandered around saw lots of other stuff not all of it notable kinda wishing it was raining then I went back to my room once again and tried listening to music a bit but felt that I wasn’t enjoying it so I chose to listen to the sound of the steam and wind chimes outside laying in bed looking out the window trying to relax a bit but with the body high and my current mood it was hard so I smoked a little weed and stared out the window watching the colors of the little light that steamed in change and also just closing my eyes and focusing on my breathing started to imagine lots of things the type of thing where you go around pleasantly imagining whatever imagines and concepts are to your liking and forget many of them. Quite a bit of time had passed by now I had deffenilty started to come down past the peak a while ago I settled in some more relaxed reflected on my life and this experience maybe went on the computer again and watched something I’m not sure then I went to sleep (After a while of laying there). Something I took away from this was the feeling that on shrooms you can kinda take the experience and mood however you want to go or in a multiplicity of directions. Anyway it was awesome this description doesn’t do it justice and I can wait to try it again.TLDR- was awesome can’t wait to try it in a different setting and on a higher dose in the future would highly recommend Thanks again Trip!","psychedelics","839",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"703",NA,"lsd & mdma avengers review thread see op","I had a chance to drop two of JOR's 277ug highest grade stuff yesterday... and wowThese tabs are really extraordinary. They were a bit hard for me to place exactly. They seem like very high quality fluff. There's no real body load at all and they are deeply euphoric but there is a pretty decent amount of mindmelding. The kind where you can stare a wall for a half hour with only a thought or two. I was pretty beat the whole time as well the day kind of just got away from me and I did not get myself the proper food or water I should have so this could have contributed to that. These tabs are the most visual LSD i have ever eat in my life. I was blown out of the water how intricate patterns were. Rich colorful and full of details. These tabs provided such a full experience overall. I was still going when I woke up the next day with visuals crazier than the last few trips ive had 16 hours after dosing. these tabs are just amazingly strong reminscent of TOC but better. I really want to eat alot of these sometime. These certainly aren't the cleanest of the clean but this crystal wins in another sense.. it is really standout from all the other LSD ive had this year. Praise Jesus! Every tab I try from JOR feels like way more than it is advertised as. Truly a lovely ultra fresh lay.

So I took the vial and after about an hour I started to notice the effects it was somewhat odd I noticed there was this strange ""beam"" of energy that was projecting off of electronics (cells and computers) drugs (especially Psychedelics such as LSD or Psilocybin) alters the way your mind works. Humans do not see the actual reality your brain only renders around 30 - 50% of what's real. Psychedelics allow the human mind to to see more of what's there like radiation.The visuals were nice no nausea during the come-up I looked up at the sky and the clouds looked as if they were smiling then I started watching people how confused they looked how they live in their dream world of illusions dillusions and ignorance.I've bought a few different psilocybin products off the silk road before and I find that Trip's product is the best. There's no nausea (less risk of entering a ""bad trip"") no risk of getting moldy mushrooms (I've known a few people who almost died after eating moldy mushrooms) and great stealth.","psychedelics","205",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Around 7:10 I realized I wasn't seeing anything so I took the other half of the vile. About 15 minutes later I started to get my first hallucinations. My blankets looks liked they had fingers and my table looked flat when I looked at it the right way. My depth perception was very strange as well. Those were the only hallucinations I experienced. Kind of bummed out but damn did I feel good. The high itself was so much fun and lasted forever. I loved it. Will come back for more in the future.

"708",NA,"lsd review - pimpit","Ok...So i first purchased a 10-strip from pimpit in July. Obviously he has stellar reviews and his reputation speaks for himself. Communication was excellent and shipping was fast. I received my order as promised. However... I took 3 tabs a friend took 2 and another took 1... nothing happened.I did mention this to pimpit -- with all due respect -- and he promised to re-ship 5 in good faith noting that the summer months make shipping his product vast distances notoriously difficult. Understood... i suppose although other summer shoppers were reporting quality product.Nevertheless I received my 5-strip re-ship. I didn't mention this to him until September because i was taking a lot of lsd in the summer so i wanted to take a good 4-week break to ensure a quality trip. Many reported one tab (220-250ug) as being awe-inspiring as 200-250ug should be... It is my opinion that 300-500 things get zany and loopy and transcendental but 200-250 is great for a saturday night at home with a quality record collection and good company.This past saturday I took 1 tab and i've enough experience with lsd to say it was NOT anywhere near 200-250ug. SunWu advertises 150ug and one of his tabs were at least 2x as strong. 1 tab of pimpit's blotter made me feel goofy but no introspection no psychedelia no distorted perception nothing of the classic lsd experience. It was clean and it wasnt an RC... i think it was a 30-75 ug tab with 75 being a very generous maximum.Now... here's what im thinking: maybe the vendors on SR are selling quality lsd albeit dosed low. The high dose is great for advertising but so far SunWu appears to have been the only vendor who delivered an accurately rated dose of 150ug. Hands down. and now he's gone...Tessellated is the same deal... i complained about them being duds but most of us know his customer service reputation. I will take a break and I will try king of extracts 100ug ""concert doses""... if theyre accurately dosed i can compare 100ug to SunWu's 150ug... but tessellated and pimpit were just -- sad to say -- disappointing. And im not an INSANE head with a huge tolerance... i like to trip HARD about 10 times a year at the most with the occasional 150ug night but i usually drop at least 250-400ug...So anyway... take it for what it's worth. An honest review. I have no vendetta against pimpit or tess... I am just looking to secure consistent quality product. It'd be nice if one tab can do it but with pimpit my best guess is i would need at least 4-5 tabs to get to where id like to be versus sunwu who can ALMOST get me there in 1 and get easily get me there with 2.... Anyway: your feedback is much appreciated because i still dont understand why some bonafide psychedelic heads have been raving and drooling about pimpit's stuff when one several occasions i've dropped and waited and waited... and waited... until by hour 3 i'm convinved lift off won't be achieved.thanks!

"709",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","TRIP REPORT:Trip is the man! I want to tell all about my trip report it was simply. Amazing. I weigh about 137 5'10 and this was my first time. I'll start by saying that I prepared for this trip and woke up on a bright and sunny sunday morning emoty stomach packed the bags and with my gf in hand were off. I went to my local elementary school park (it's huge and I attended when younger so positive vibes) I was in a happy mood nervous but still excited. So overall good vibes. I drank one vial in a shot glass with some V8 Fusion it took about 30-45 minutes for me to peak but when I peaked it all started my gf played a video of a dude lecturing a teacher about teaching his voice sounded SO funny I started laughing hysterically then I got fuzzy and started to see the trees bend after that I felt super light like I felt as though my spirit could just lift away but in a chill type of way gradually the ground began to wave up and down up and down it looked cartoonish and I could pick out a certain area and just dive into it and turn it into a bright painting it was awesome. Things could spin to a point or twist it was insanely dope. And ZERO NAUSEA!!! After that the mental trip set in and I thought about everything but in a good way I thought about the death of my grandmother and how I needed to let her go because her death impacted me so much my gf (who only smokes weed) was like woah..chill but I was able to explain to her that this is me growing up and she understood! (a first lol) she was totally with it and started to hear me out and talked with me. It was hands down the most beautiful experience I've ever had. Doing this would've been a TOTALLY differen't experience in a room with friends or alone or at night or just trying to trip balls I know it was only one vial but one vial was enough to change alot for me. So please If this is your first time BE POSITIVE! BE HAPPY! BE EXCITED and know what setting your getting into! Do one vial and take it to learn and explore yourself it's just the right amount. I will definitely be ordering from Trip again good man great communication awesome product TWS is embedded in my memory forever! Thanks for the beautiful experience and please be smart with the Psilo it's nothing to play around with! cheers.","psychedelics","445",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"710",NA,"retirement announcement*~sunwu feedback thread~~ lsd specific review","here is HoS guide to laying blotters...i guess i will just have to use this method but a tenth of the sizeand no blotters lol. maybe drip on some candy if i want too...QuoteI have long told people I would bring out my laying TEK for the community. Well without further ado here it is.Laying Blotter by House of SpiritLet us assume you can obtain the following.A page of 900 hits of standard commercially available blotter paper (this works for anything comparable to most mainstream available to buy blotter art must be modified for each types of paper based on their absorbancy see knowing your paper below.)90-100mg of xtal (to account for any crystal impurities let us assume you use 100 this lays roughly110 mics per hit of crystal which you then have to multiply by your purity assuming a 95% crystal that is 104.5 ug per tab)EverclearVodkaEither a 10ml syringe or a 4x3ml syringes (I prefer 4x3ml for a later step)A pyrex dish or porcelain plate that is roughly the same size as your pageA drying surface such as a bed of nails or something else with limited contact and uniform support. I had a custom glass bed of nails made in a pyrex dish had a blower friend make it for a sheet.Optional:A magnetic stirrerAn analytical balance scale if you have more than 100mg of crystal. Only an analytical balance good to .1mg will do. That means it can determine a difference of 100ug.First off I can hear you saying ""WOAH Everclear and Vodka why? Don't people just use Everclear?""To answer this I give you an partial entry from Tihkal. The last lines from Synthesis read     ""Repeated recrystallizations from methanol produced a product that became progressively less soluble and eventually virtually insoluble as the purity increased. A totally pure salt when dry and when shaken in the dark will emit small flashes of white light. ""The final part is just to make you smile. But you will note as purity increases alcohol solubility decreases this is why we bring out the vodka so that we can assist the solubility by adding water that we know is clean and mixed well with alcohol. Most salts HCL Fumurate Mallerate and others all are water soluble.Take your Everclear and your vodka and mix them in the ratio of 8:2 (Everclear:Vodka). Eight parts Everclear to two parts Vodka. I mix solvents to make about 100ml at a time then store once mixed in an airtight container.Mix it well preferably using a magnetic stirrer for an hour if not use a large 3-10ml syringe and suck and spray it for about 15 minutes to ensure somewhat uniform mixing.Now draw back between 10 ml into the 10ml syringe or 2.5ml per 3ml syringe then draw some air for shaking as your solution may want to cloud up again (depends on initial mixing) if left too long as it will be what chemists call a super saturated solution. ( An important note here. Each of the major commercially available papers you can buy out there has a different amount of liquid it needs know your paper).A note about knowing your paper and a way to get a better number than a flat 10 ml.Two ways to get an exact amount.1. Weigh 10ml of liquid. Weigh your paper. Saturate your paper weigh it subtract paper weight weigh and double check remaining liquid weight to confirm. Measure how many ml are left subtract from initial 10 to get your number.2. Dry runs. Buy extra pages. And test a few with varying amounts of liquid working up until you find a sweet spot where it absorbs fully does not run off and has no dry spots.But it is IMPERATIVE that you know your paper. 10ml works for some heavy art like much of the main stream commercial. 8.7-9ml for some of the others my NoB and Elf paper only took 8ml I have no idea who made those they were made anonymously. Blotter Made by various places and bought randomly has taken between 8 and ten roughly consistently at a 7.5 x 7.5 900 hit page. My new pages vary as well and I always test them personally. Know your paper.Lay your sheet face down on your chosen laying dish or plate.Take your crystal and put it into a glass container appropriate for mixing and drawing liquid from.Add your solvent.Either using a magnetic stirrer or the suck and blow method mix the living hell out of that crystal. The longer you work it the more the stubborn bits will break down and join the solution. Unless you are working with sparking crystal there will be some that just won't go. You now have the aforementioned super saturated solution.Once you are done mixing suck it back into your syringe(s) and cap it (them). Allow it to settle for about 2 mins to check for cloudiness and then shake it. You will note that your solution may be milky and or cloudy that is because it is several times thicker than you would take in liquid. Super saturated. Depending on the crystal purity it will cloud more or less than another batch.If you get your alcohol and water ratio perfect it will not cloud at all. You want it to not cloud if possible.Note- I prefer 3ml syringes for the next part but will give instructions as if you are going to understand the direction I am going.If you have it in 4 syringes this part is easier if it is in 1 syringe you have to be careful and pay attention to your fourths.Turning to your sheet you will need to think of it in fourths as well. Top quarter middle quarters bottom quarter.Starting at one end begin to squirt the liquid back and forth across the pages working your way down one quarter per syringe or one quarter of your syringe as you do each quarter tip the sheet (very slightly) in the direction of the unfinished areas. Try to work as meticulously as possible leaving as little blank space as you can.Tipping will help extra liquid migrate. And as you do so you will begin to see it migrate from blotter to blotter.Continue working down towards the end opposite from which you started. By the time you have reached the bottom you will have used 9-9.5 ml of liquid and will probably have had to tip it back to avoid run off be careful here and you will be fine and will lose almost nothing. The remaining .3-.5ml you use to cover the last spots to have absorbed or spots that look undersaturated and then you also tip it a little bit to let is uniformly absorb the rest.Make sure to tilt your pan or dish to ensure as it is evapping the liquid moves into the blotter uniformly you can see this in the moisture content of the paper on the surface. Water also helps with this as it slows evap pure Everclear can create a problem with too fast of an evap and crystal dropping out and showing on the surface of the blotter.Once the alcohol has evapped move your sheet to your drying surface. Do not move it prematurely wait until the liquid will not pool or cause bowing as liquid will still migrate if left and doing so would create hot spots.Your drying surface should be something like a lipped baking dish smaller than your page or if possible a bed of nails or glass nails.Your sheet will dry relatively swiftly at this point and should be ready for an airtight packaging within a half hour to an hour.Next trip testing and blacklight checks are in order to ensure you have no hot spots.If those come out you are golden. Congrats you just laid a full page and contrary to the old ChinaCat post unless you intentionally lick up the mop up or lick solution on your hands you will not get high at all. I have laid 5 grams at a time without getting high. The only time I accidentally dose is if I touch my mouth with solution.Scientific experimentation has proven that bio-availability of LSD absorbed through the skin is negligible at best. Nick Sands once used 1 gram of DMSO-LSd solution and painted his arms with it to no effect. But touch those lips or a mucus membrane and that is a different story.Lots of LoveHouse.","psychedelics","1407",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"711",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I bought two vials. I drank one a week ago and one just last weekend. I think that drinking both at the same time would be best for me. I just need to find a double straw.Both nights were very similar experiences. It came on fast. Like within minutes. I was meditating and was very keen on the subtle effects coming almost immediately. I was reminded of ayahuasca. The way that sometimes with ayahuasca you don't know if the wave is going to take you or just wash by. (I think this is because I cooked my own ayahuasca and really had a difficult time getting the technique to be a consistent brew)So aside from comparisons I'll just say that for about 15 minutes it was amazing and then it's as though I didn't have the strength to keep up. Almost like waking up from a weird dream. I felt the very familiar mushroom effects for quite awhile but the spiritual vehicle sort of sifted me through the bottom rails while taking off.I think I was physically exhausted from the work week and being a dad. And trying to squeeze in a mushroom trip late into the night. I very much recommend this product. Liquid mushrooms seem to be the best way I've ever done mushrooms. I wish they were liquid azurescens.Â I used to grind mushrooms in a coffee grinder and make honey tea. This product was far better than that.Next time I will drink two vials...maybe three.

"712",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Hello Anons! I'm back for another wild story to tell of my third and most recent trip with TWS's product!I recently went camping with a buddy on a nearby river and I decided that would be an awesome time to explore the potential of psilocybin outdoors as opposed to my last amazing experience indoors. My second trip (which I have not made/will not make a report for) was nothing special. I had alcohol that night and it heavily muddied the experience for me.  Anyways back to my report of my third trip!Camping on the river. Ahhh the life.  It's a cloudy day with threatening clouds looming nearby. Little did we know of the night that was to come.  After hanging out for the afternoon and getting camp setup (our own private single-person tents) we fired up the wood to prepare for dinner.  Kobe beef burgers never tasted so amazing after a day of work.  My buddy was aware that I was planning on tripping that evening and he was unsure if he wanted to partake in my activities.  I brought 3 vials of TWS's psilocybin for a total of 1.5 each (which is what I took my first time... very solid trip btw go read my report several pages back  ).  After dinner I took 1 full one.  The sun was behind the mountains lighting up the cloud covered sky with brilliant orange/purple colors.  As the drug came on the clouds started to move almost wavelike. I'd see them flow a direction and then come back to where they really were.  It was awesome.  The distant lightning began and some faint thunder echoed through the cayon above the river.  The clouds became thicker and thicker and we'd get touched by light sprinkles of rain.  We could see the raindrops move across the river by the ripples they created and then we'd get lightly touched by it as it blew by.  This happened a few times and then the rain got heavy.  And I mean heavy.  We had to retreat into our separate tents to stay dry (and warm) and this was awesome.  The wind and rain was hammering my tent blowing it all around while I'm laying inside yelling to my buddy exclaiming how much of a fun time I was having. By this time we were right in the middle of the lightning storm with huge cracks of thunder after immediate flashes of light.  It was awesome... not scary one bit.  That lasted for about 20 minutes and all was still again.  Our sandy beach was now damp.  We went back out to our camp chairs and my buddy immediately sat down in his not realizing there was a pool of ice cold rain water about 4 inches deep.  His scream from the shock of ice water right on the sac had me rolling for at least 5 minutes.  It was the funniest thing I've ever witnessed.  By this point the clouds had blown through and we could finally look up and see some stars. This was about an hour or more into my trip.  I would point out some stars in disbelief because to me they were moving.... only to be corrected by my friend who says no dude... those are stationary.  I wanted to take another half vial so I prepped my bottle and camp water for ingestion.  I ended up spilling a few drops (maybe about 10% of a vial) so I said screw it and took the rest of what was left.  All in all I had damn near a full 2 vials after this... something I've never done.  It hit pretty quickly and I remember seeing stars in patterns as if they were all connected by some magical line that went through each one and onto the next.  I also remember seeing stars bounce into other stars in the sky.  It was truly amazing.  Then I started seeing a colorful yet somewhat faint pattern overlay on top of my normal vision.  I knew it was time for me to go kick back and enjoy the real entertainment of the trip: what I see inside my mind.  It took me awhile to get back in my tent but I wish I would've gone sooner.  This is where my trip turned bad.The rain made all the bugs crawl out of their demolished sandy homes.  I stood there and stared at them for what seemed like 10 minutes... everything from beetles rollie pollies red ants small spiders and began to worry that they also would have gotten into my open tent and bag.  One of my biggest pet peeves while camping is getting the inside of my tent/sleeping bag dirty.  Having wet sandy feet was the worst thing ever. It was almost confusing for me to try to clean them off... and very frustrating.  Anyways I made it in after probably 10 minutes of cleaning my feet off zipped up the tent... and it got very hot/humid/stuffy very fast. I did not like it one bit.  I looked at the foot end of my tent and saw a couple bugs crawling around and though ""great now the bugs are in here with me too"".  I started whispering to myself. I said ""Alright dude... I'm trippin out.  I am really freaking out. Calm down.""  I laid down very uncomfortable knowing there were bugs and sand down in my tent... plus the heat/humidity.  It was just not comfortable at all.  I felt chlostrophobic. I tried to close my eyes and let my mind wonder but everywhere I went I would see all sorts of bugs in the patterns.  Very vivid too.  It was not good.  I thought they're nothing. They're just in my mind.  Follow them and see where they go.  I tried to direct my mind to where they were coming from and as soon as I accepted them they disappeared. What a relief... but a temporary relief at that.  They were back very quickly.  I tried to listen to music and it just didn't feel right.  I felt a bug crawling on my leg... had to find my flashlight in the dark only to grab it and throw him out of the tent.  There were too many distractions.  I started listening (with headphones of course) to Underoath - Down Set Go... one of my favorite long-term songs.  It sounded amazing and so clear.  It almost felt as if the singer was speaking directly to me.  I could feel his pain and it began to sadden me.  After listening to that song 4 or 5 times I realized I didn't want to go down that sadness path.  It would have only continued to suck me in.  I changed to Deadmau5 - Strobe... a very carefully put together masterpiece of electronic music.  I couldn't make it the whole 10 minutes without feeling another bug on my foot/leg or seeing bugs in my head.  It was awful.  I was dead tired and wanted to close my eyes but I couldn't because I was afraid of what I saw.  I came out of my tent after about 30 minutes and told my buddy I don't feel well.  I sat and chilled for a minute disappointed that my mind ""bitched out"" on me.  Then I began feeling nauseous and I threw up whatever psilocybin was left in my stomach.  It was still a great experience... a learning one indeed.  I could have freaked out MUCH worse I'm sure if I didn't like rain or thunder or if I didn't have the mental capacity that I do.  It was just the bugs and the sandy feet that got to me.  It sounds lame I know... but you'd have to experience it to understand. Quite a long review I know... but the good is just as important as the bad.  Happy tripping!","psychedelics","1309",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"713",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","First off let me just start off by saying this was my first experience with Psilocybin but I have pretty hefty experience with DMT (and other non-tryptamine psychedelics) previous to this.Usually I take notes during new experiences but I was too lost inside of my own head to take any meaningful notes after the come up. I would like to quote one thing though (this was around T+0:10 a short ways into the come up):5:21 (T0:06) Wrote this why I am not sure. Felt like I needed to get it down.""I am here as I jump into the realm of the unknown to bring further light into my mind. I am not only doing this for myself but for my future self and all that may learn from me. My experiences are only the start of something that will flower into something much more beautiful I am ready to take whatever is thrown at me. As a student I come to the molecule to teach me about anything it wishes too and I will observe with great interest the things it has to tell.""While writing this and experiencing the come up I could see the beauty in everything around me and wished nothing but love onto everyone and everything in existance. I've had similar mindsets on low doses of LSD and DMT but this general vibe continued on throughout the trip.The pretrip setting was the usual: late after noon no one else with me dosed after some meditation to calm down my nerves. Most of the experience was spent laying down on a couch. Some ambient spacey music was played but I quickly forgot about it as I went into my own head. It should also be noted that I smoked a small dose of DMT mid-way through the plateu; this brought on a very large amount of physical intensity (in a good way it was the psychedelic version of an opiate rush I suppose) but didn't add much in the way of visual effects. Just as a note I had prepared a pretty extensive play list prior to this but was never in the mood to play it. As for the actual trip it came on HARD and it came on FAST. I had a relativly empty stomach when I dosed 1 vial over the course of about 10 minutes mixed in with gingerale to combat any nausea (which never manifested astounding considering my stomach is pretty sensitive to seritonergics. I ate a rather large plate of chilli half way through the come down in fact). First alerts were felt in literally 5 minutes although it ramped up BIG TIME around the 15 minute mark. I started to get very very very giggly around the same time (I couldn't drink a cup of water due to how much I was laughgin). Visuals started around 25 minutes in and were characterized by text on my computer screen moving in blocks and an ""overlay"" of DMT like spirals and curls on my visual field. The open eyed patterns were characterized by a prominence of green along with reds and oranges. Closed eye visuals were intensly bright and had a strong ""feel"" to them with a color scheme exactly matching the color scheme my visuals take on with DMT (lots of browns reds and oranges). At the start of the peak I remember closing my eyes and seeing an S shaped pattern with a lot of visuals coming off of it. The visuals weren't the most prominent aspect of the trip however as the thing that really took the cake was getting easily lost in my own head. While I was lost inside of my head my visual field was irrelevant (imagine day dreaming). I could easily switch back and forth between exploring my own head and exploring the outside world not once did I feel I was trapped in either. Everything got a lot more serious once the peak started. Although I did not experience it at the time I was on the verge of ego death. As the effects plateud out I got the feeling that ""I"" as an entity were no longer being effected by them but instead I was watching my mind unleash itself from afar as an observer. Concepts such as ""me"" and ""I"" started to lose meaning although they never went away completly. Mid way through the plateu I was faced with a dillema I felt as though there was a problem. What that problem was however I was not sure at the time. This became the main focus of the trip as I debated what could be causing me issues. Very very introspective I touched upon many aspects of myself. Eventually I focused on one thing in particular regarding an event to come and realized that my plan to deal with it was questionable and held with it risks I did not wish to take. I did not realize this before then and indeed would have taken those risks had it not have been for the trip. Once I resolved my problem the come down started. Whether or not debating this issue inside of my head prolongued the peak I'm not sure it's possible that it was the start of the come down which allowed me to sort things out. Either way a future problem got solved and I came up with a course of action (which I followed through and everything turned out better than expected).The come down was uneventful good visuals and good body feels (the actual high sensation caused by the psilocin was incredible but I was too lost in my head to enjoy it much). One thing which I noted (both on psilocin and on DMT) was that everything took on a very homey/native american vibe. It's hard to describe the vibe in words so instead picture this scene. An oldwoman is in the kitchen stirring a large pot of food. It is night outside and the only light in the room is coming from a ceiling lamp making the entire room an orange hue. In the next room over children are sitting on the wooden floor playing with their toys while their parents are across the room watching them. The unique variations of comfort and hominess associated with those images was the vibe everything took on (it should be noted that I never had kids and don't know any old ladies so I have no idea what brought on this particular vibe. More fuel for further exploration I suppose). As for after effects pupils returned to their normal size after some sleep. The next day I felt baseline with no hang over of note. Emotionally I felt a bit meh not particularly happy or sad over the next few days. Could have something to do with seritonin receptor down regulation but it's more likely that it was unrelated. Overall I'd have to say that it was one of the most interesting experiences I have had to date. A very good time introspective and healing. I didn't keep any exact time logs but from dose to baseline was 5-6 hours. The come down started at 3 hours in by my estimations.","psychedelics","1200",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

So if i haven't met you hello and if i have hello again (:Ill add more info when moved to respective threads i just think each deserves a mention.GammaGoblinthe WoW tabs that GammaGoblin has = Some of the best blotter ive ever triedEveryone i gave it too said it was the best blotter they had ever experienced on one tab.So its laid with good crystal i think but of course this is entirely subjective.Ive taken up to 35 of these at once and had a very visual pleasant trip i think any others i gave away for free. Im not sure what i think this means but it was a good time. ill write a trip report once i can do a full review on his thread.Ive also tried his Mescaline on a few occassions. My first experience being a gram but much lower since. The first experience was the best and caused an out of body experience psychedelicly i have never matched.I have some mescaline analogues to compare. They are weaker but sometimes thats a good thing.Nelson MuntzIve taken various of his tabs in the past and all were good but not like GG's WoW's although at much lower dosages. Im not gonna say much because again they were high quality. Ive recently ordered some 1ml/200ug/4000ml liquid off him which i will review and do a trip report on as i personally prefer liquid and i think at the moment and i will give him a review (:TheHulksterI got 1 bottle of 1.5/100ug/6000ml (97+ percent xtal = very good) . liquid from kings habit. i accidently drugged myself with it at an unknown doseage thinking it was morphine mabye 10 hits.Mabye a week later me and my girlfriend finished the liquid with a little ket and about an oz of shrooms.we had fun. i decided this is the best acid ive ever had and ordered 2 more bottles to eventually compare with nelson muntz's acidKingOfExtractsGave me a qp of awesome shrooms which ive ordered another of to store with my libs i collect and has awesome bho.More will be added and moved to better places soon i just hope some fellow trippers interested in the little i have there just many trip reports are incomplete or arent existant yet and im fed up with finding threads about people asking about whos good for what and not being able to answerIm not able to say much about xtals as i have never consumed it this way or made anything with it.Ps.Â  Ill add item and vendor links soon too make it more comprehendble.Pss. oh and kingshabits 2cb was spot on just that drug isnt as good as what else ive mentioned","psychedelics","494",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"719",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","OriginseaTrip with Science (TWS)Shroomery 10110 October 2014Trip Report: MLA StyleBACKGROUND   First off I would like to thank TWS for having wonderful customer service super-fast shipping and superior stealth. I asked a few questions and he responded quickly with very helpful answers. Unlike some vendors who just reply with short and abrupt answers. I ordered on a Thursday night and they arrived Monday. Perfect. Also the stealth was very fine. And if anyone other than me were to open it I would have had no problems whatsoever since it doesn’t look like “drugs” at all. Now have never done any type of psychedelics before but I have always been intrigued by them. I have been smoking weed for over a year now and that is the only drug that I have ever done since before I tried mushrooms. I also weigh around 140-150 pounds. I purchased two vials but only used one of them as of now. I wrote this MLA style because I felt like a few sentences would not be enough to describe my trip. I tried to explain in full detail of what I encountered during my trip but no story will prepare you for your own experience with mushrooms. I thought that I knew what to expect but I was entirely wrong. (Not a bad thing)…THE TRIP   So it begins. It was a Wednesday and I only had two early classes which ended at around 11:00. Once I was finished with my last class I rushed out of the classroom and headed straight for my car. I drove home super excited just as a young kid is for Christmas morning. Once I got home I unpacked my things turned on almost all the lights so it’s not all dark and spooky and I grabbed one vial along with some orange juice out of my fridge. I took a cup and poured the two liquids together and then downed the drink on my completely empty stomach. According to TWS one vial was equal to two grams of dried shrooms. I did not think that was too much but since I have never done it before I thought that I should start off with a small dose. Also I didn’t taste it at all. This was very reliving because I was afraid for a nasty taste. After downing the drink I made some toast and sat outside. About 10 minutes passed and still nothing. I thought maybe it might not work for me or maybe I need to do more. So I went back inside pulled out my phone and tried to play some music through my sound system. I suddenly realized that choosing a song was insanely difficult for some reason. This is when I realized it was kicking in. I started to feel completely different and almost confused. The music was crazy and almost too much at the moment. I just lied down on my couch and stared at my ceiling only to notice that it was much more vibrant and really seemed to be pulsating in and out. For some reason this was absolutely hilarious and I laughed a lot. This is when I decided to go outside. Luckily I live right in front of a forest with some trails in it so I decided to explore. As I crawled through the trees and bushes to get on one of the trails it was like walking into Narnia. I felt like I was entering a different world. A world of nature. As soon as I got out of the brush I took a stick on the ground and wrote a big H on the middle of the path for “Home.” I set the stick down next to it for this is how I was going to identify where to head back. I walked around the forest with awe and astonishment. Staring at every little thing and observing its details. At one point I decided to look at my hands and I just busted out laughing. I just thought that they were so amazing and that they have so much potential in life. Now unfortunately the woods are next to this school and it was around noon so I heard all of these kids running outside. This frightened me. I didn’t want to make any social interaction and I just didn’t want to be that creeper guy walking around the woods by himself. As I headed back the sound of kids vanished so I must have gotten far away from them. I felt like going back inside but then a big gust of wind blew all the trees all around me and it felt like the forest was telling me to stay. So it did. It was truly magical. I ended up walking in a loop and ended up where I started. I saw the big “H” on the ground and decided it was time to head back. One cool thing was that I completely lost my sense of time. I was worried that I was gone for a long time but it was really only about 45 minutes. Little did I know that this was just the beginning.    I got back inside and everything was much quieter. Probably because it was such a windy day outside. I plugged in some Pink Floyd and just sat down listening to the music. After a couple songs things got too intense for me so I turned down the music and lied down in my bed. I had the window open so the sun could shine through and it was so amazing. Since it was a cloudy day the sun would be “on and off” when it was off my room would be a darker tone but once the sun turned on everything got all bright and super colorful. Plus the ceiling looked like it was breathing with me. It was awesome.    Later at around 2:00 I decided to watch some TV. And boy was it fucked up. The first thing that was on was the Amazing World of Gumball which I have watched before and I kind of like it but on mushrooms it was so bright clear and vivid and made absolutely no sense at all. The colors were always changing and I loved it. Later I changed the channel to see what else was on and it turned out to be all this cooking show on some talk show which was fucked up. I was like why are hundreds of these people watching this guy make some mashed potatoes? It was an incredibly stupid show. At this point I was like nope too much TV and decided to just go back into my room and lie down again. This was my favorite part. The part where all of my body euphoria went away but my mind was still running like crazy. With my notebook and pen I sketched down whatever came to my mind. I was thinking so much about everything. The three main things were my life the world and nature. I wrote “Life can be complex sometimes. We just have to slow down and enjoy the moment.” This is when I came up with a small quote called “Stop. Live.” To me this meant to stop what you are doing and to appreciate the true beauty that God has created for you. This was so inspirational at the moment that I got a few tears in my eyes. After that I began to come down more which surprisingly felt amazing. Everything was so clear to me now. I stepped outside and took a deep breath in as I gazed at the swaying trees. I had learned to appreciate nature more and that every single little thing on this earth is beautiful. I loved it. I finished the day with an amazing bike ride around the park. I am pretty sure I was smiling most of the time just admiring all of the amazing wonders of nature. Finally I would like to thank trip once again. Thank you for creating this liquid psilocybin creation that opened up my mind and made me a happier person. You really are awesome and know how to satisfy your customers.

"720",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I'd like to preface this trip report by saying that this was my first time using psilocybin and that my experiences have been three times with acid (worked my way up to 350ug) about half a dozen rolls and also half a dozen time smoking weed.I'd rate the intensity of the experience around the equivalent of 140ug of acid maybe a little higher.  On the other hand this was a completely different experience than those I've had on lucy.  I've notice several defining differences the first being that the body high was of a different sort","I felt more couchlocked on shrooms than I did on lsd.  Naturally the trip lasted about half as long but despite the fact that it shared many visual traits with lsd the trip tended to be geared towards the headspace rather than the visuals.  I found that unlike in my previous trips I couldn't stand the sound of blaring electronic music and actually listened almost strictly to classical music for the duration of this trip.After getting through a quick come up wherein I experienced some quite amazing closed eye visuals only to open them and find that everything has adopted a leafy green hue (this lasted for several minutes) I gathered the energy to head over to my piano.  The piano sits in front of a large window and it was pouring rain outside.  At this point i've started peaking (45mins to an hour after drinking the vial with some OJ) and I open the window sit down and begin to improvise.  Although I do this a lot sober this was unlike any other time I've fawned over a piano the cool gusts of wind and specks of rain landing on my skin through the mesh screen over the window combined with the storm outside my house amounted to what I consider one of the most beautiful experiences of my life I felt like my hands took on a life of their own.  After doing this for 30+ minutes I retired to my room and turned on more classical music specifically mozart's requiem.  While listening I epiphanized on a personal matter and found that my thoughts felt more patient than they did while on acid.   Perhaps shrooms might be more conducive to epiphany?  I sat in my bed and mulled over my experience and three hours after taking the vial I ate two hash candies (which I was also trying for the first time).  These kicked in within half an hour and the rest of the day was spent in extreme comfort just watching movies and basking in my previous musical experience.I felt that one vial was an excellent starting point for shrooms.  I'm going to take a month or so to mull over this experience as well as my utterly different 350ug acid trip before doing this again but believe me I will.  I've never eaten regular shrooms and now I never will liquid psilocybin is where it's at.  Next time I think I'll do 1.5 to 2 vials but that's still a long way away and I feel like I have a lot to think about from this last trip.Thank you TWS for your amazing product this was awesome.  Shipping was very fast and the stealth was impeccable.","psychedelics",546,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"722",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","I had originally planned on tripping with 2 of my buddies but they went out of town the weekend I wanted to drink the vial. So I decided to trip by myself at around 2:20pm Saturday. I had eaten lunch about an hour prior to consumption so expected a 45 minute onset. WELL... after about 20 minutes I could feel the slight tingle start in my head. It felt almost like a very clear headed weed high at first accompanied by a silly smile that I could not remove from my face and endless giggles. I had no idea what I was even laughing about but it just felt so good. I had minor visuals I remember going out on the patio of my apartment and seeing the trees blow in the stormy winds. The leaves and branches of the trees seemed to move in 3 separate parts all in unison. As if dancing to the wind. Then I noticed that the tree line took on a peculiar appearance. They still looked very much like trees but the sillouettes of them appeared to be skully and took the shape of large golem like ""monsters."" It was not scary in the least bit but more amusing. When I noticed there were people in the parking lot and thought of them seeing me staring in awe at nothing it made me nervous and I went back inside to the bedroom. I tried to see some CEVs but it was almost like I had to struggle for them to slightly appear so maybe I was not in the right headspace.I suppose the best part of the experience was the feeling of euphoria. I remember constantly telling myself ""this is great I don't want this experience to ever end."" When I noticed I was coming down I started to smoke some weed from my vape. The euphoria continued and the comedown was not harsh at all. I stayed very happy the entire experience and I cannot wait to try it again. I will probably consume two vials my next trip and see how deep that will take me. This was my first experience with shrooms and I absolutely loved it!!! I have one trip with 2c-e and this topped it on every aspect. Great product Great vendor and Great stealth!

"723",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","So I received this lovely looking vial filled with a lovely looking fluid that took me to the cosmos. It tasted pretty bad yes but compared to the non-liquid form it tasted like heaven. I tripped alone because people tend to fuck it up.I drank it and it took about an hour to set in. First sign was when I started to feel really tall like a giant on a planet much too small for me. Then when my blankets started moving I pretended my head was a ship and sailed through those blanket waves and was like ""fuck I'm tripping."" But that was only a prelude to the majesty that would soon alight upon me. I had a great urge to go outside and so I did - though before then I had been playing in the mirror with my face because it kept changing shape - for like an hour. When I stepped outside I could not help but look up at the sky; it seemed so majestic so imposing. I walked for awhile just admiring the sky when I came upon this great oak tree - and it had this aura of ancient wisdom - and I saw stone statues carved onto the bark and I talked to the faces and listened to their contemplations on the universe.I then sat on a park bench and took out my notebook when my ego died and from a distance I watched myself write a bunch of philosophical concepts. My hand moved against my will; or rather I had no will and so I just let it do its thing. My mind too was split in two and I conversed with the myself who was in control.Afterwards I walked up to this fantastic sculpture in front of where I live and I patted it and felt the imprints of man in the smooth and varied surface of the thing. Then by not looking at any part of my body I believed that I did not exist that I was just a part of the environment neither living nor dying and just there occupying a space in time as an immobile observer - like a rock or like a part of the sculpture.I decided to circle the block a few times more and during this walk I saw two little girls playing on the grass giggling with joy and I thought it was the most beautiful spectacle on the planet a play enacted by the universe where I had first class seats to watch the workings of the cosmos here before this microcosm. I then recalled my childhood and believed that I too had gone back to when I was a child when the world was a world of discovery and excitement and love and wonder and I felt reconciled with my existence.Soon the sun was setting and I sat and watched the bold streaks of gold and orange expand and compress in the distance as I thought about the flaws of humanity and the flaws within myself. Behind me there was a loud rattle and I turned to see two squirrels chasing each other so fluid and pure that they turned into these beautiful blurs of motion; and I thought I hope I may live like the squirrels do - so capable of being.But this recount does injustice to the true experience so much deeper and profound than my shallow words can convey.","psychedelics","573",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"724",NA,"lsd & mdma avengers review thread see op","This weekend I tried out House of Spirit's Jesus Christ print with Dutch grey xtal on it. This experience was a pretty far cry from my trip on JOR's stuff 6 days earlier. There was perhaps a bit of tolerance that contributed. But whereas JOR's stuff was very hard hitting mentally physically and visually this was much more lucid and even keel. On JOR's I was lost in the moment completely absorbed in what I was doing on this I had that to a degree (it always happens on L) but I was more just at peace. Enjoying the clarity and really loving myself and the whole of existence very dearly. This stuff has some very slick visuals. Open but especially closed eye. They were actually forming some images as opposed to just patterns. In the body: no complaints at all. This stuff was perfectly fine.

"725",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Trip reportBackground: I have not touched psychedelics nor have I touched shrooms before. I am a daily weed smoker the usual wake and bake and all that stuff. I’ve done MDMA/E/XTC before at raves and doing them therapeutically (house rolls alone and stuff). I’ve also done ketamine and have experienced several instances of k-holing. Prior to this trip I had used MDMA+Ketamine 4 weeks before.TRIP:11:30PM: Ingested the Psilocybin extract (approx. 2Gs of dried shrooms) by pouring it into my cup of orange juice and have not eaten anything since 3PM. 11:35PM: Went for a walk in the park (Well maintained and has perfectly manicured grass and shit and is surrounded by trees) that is right outside my house.11:45PM: Woah things are kicking in I feel a bit uncomfortable in the stomach (barely noticeable but its there) I’m getting really giggly and lights are getting really bright and vivid.  I decide it was time to go walk towards the boat dock to look out into the sea to see other city lights and chill.11:55PM: Things are becoming more intense the lights are moving seeing fractal patterns moving around in the night sky visuals become more intense and the surge of euphoria hit me like a brick. I decide to go home. 12:00 AM: Luckily my place wasn’t too far away and I got home safe and sound. I prepped my room prior to the trip so when I came home it was dark with visualizers playing on my PC monitor and chromecast casting youtube/Netflix on my TV from my phone.  Music playing (mainly listened to gold panda pogo and chill electronic music).12:05 AM – 12:45AM: OEVs are becoming more prominent more defined and more colorful. Things become a blur (mentally) and I giggle INTESNSELY during this time period. Was reality being morphed into perception? Or was perception morphed into reality? It something I don’t think I will figure out the answer to. Also managed to put on the “Moving Art” documentary on Netflix ( I personally recommend Moving Arts Forest and Desert). I start tearing up in the middle of it because everything seemed so beautiful.12:45AM – 1AM: I cannot stop laughing for some reason and time is going by so slowly like 1 minute goes by and it feels like 2 hours or something similar like that. I just started noticing walls “breathing” and for some reason my brain keep projecting an image of a girl that I swear I have n ever met before and I swear it is like I am seeing the future of my social life for some reason. 1AM – 1:30AM: During this time period I found it hard to leave my bed things were really intense but it was not scary at all pretty pleasant.  Everything is breathing….everything. I’m seeing eyes and faces but for some reason it seems as though they are looking after me nothing really scary. I felt really in tune with my surroundings but at the same time the trip seems to be way too intense at the moment and is scaring me a bit so I go out onto the balcony to smoke some ganja. 1:30AM – 2AM: The ganja really helped me calm down a bit more but it wasn’t really affecting the trip. Being out on the balcony is great. You can see the stars and you can see the park that is right outside. The stars seem to be dancing and sometimes I swear I saw faint outlines of alien spacecraft but I knew I was tripping haha. By 2AM everything was calmer in terms of giggles and euphoria. 2AM – 3AM: OEVs are still really prominent; I don’t have to try in order to see them. I decide to put on some fractal visualizer animation thing on my tv and screen. I lay down on my bed stared into the ceiling and it seemed like the ceiling was endless. It was like the patterns were being sucked into a black hole warping the fabric of space and time while creating infinite ceiling adventures. MOAR FRACTALS! MOAR PATTERNS! (Also gave myself a light show with my LED gloves.)3AM – 4AM: OEVs are getting weaker but they are still there giggles have completely subsided by the middle of this time period.  I’m still seeing eyes and faces but again it wasn’t scary and it seemed like they had my back. Everything is still breathing and the patterns are still everywhere.  During this phase I was actually able to communicate with people online and stuff.4AM – 5AM: OEVs are weak but they surge back up every now and then. CEVs are still pretty good. I turn on visualizers for my PC monitor and nature documentaries on my TV and lay back in bed. I still can’t really tell if lines are still wiggly or if lines are back to being straight.  After this time period I call it a night and go to sleep.NEXT DAY:I did not feel any sort of ""hangover"" like you might have with stuff like MDMA.Conclusion: Shrooms was a really interesting experience. It was not as introspective/spiritual/self-exploration than I thought it would be but then again it was my first time taking any sort of psychedelic. I felt like a child again but at the same time I had the analytical power of an “adult” brain. I was trying to peel off the layers of everything trying to think about a lot of stuff trying to get in deeper. I also did the same thing with visuals trying to reveal more within the patterns and fractals trying to understand my surroundings in a deeper more meaningful sense. This trip was overall a positive experience with a bit of negativity in the fact that for a little while shit just became so intense and giggly.All in all shrooms is something I definitely have to try again as I feel that it is a drug where first experience doesn’t really mean that it would be the best one.","psychedelics","1002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"726",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Trip ReportFirst I don't pussyfoot about with party planning. Ordered 20 vials (2 bonus ones sent very cool thanks) a weird movie called ""The Salton Sea Plagues and Pleasures"" and 2 gross of whippits. On deck is a bar down the street with an excellent band my outstanding homemade psychedelic music mix driving MProject visuals on the flat screen and the movie ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" as the dessert. We were ready!Now I guess you might call me an experienced tripper  GD NYE show 25 hits rescued a friend from a bad trip who thought his 6 hits was a lot but that's another story. In the past I have not had much luck with mushrooms. I've taken over a 1/4oz and the other people will take 1 or 2 caps and after an hour I'm trying to decide it I'm feeling anything while everyone else tripping hard. A few of months ago I tried some powdered azurescens shrooms (very potent) took around 1/4 oz of those and had a decent trip. So I was looking forward to trying this liquid. The plan was me and 4 friends to party the night away one flaked so it was just the 4 of us. L had not tripped in 10 years S had shroomed a few times and Q was the friend who I had recused at the dead show but otherwise very experienced. A most excellent group of friends to party with. 8pm is lift off.Now with LSD I know my saturation point (around 300-400ug) but this shroom thing for me is relatively unexplored. So I decide to hit it hard with 8 vials and everyone else went with my recommendation of 2 each. Poured the vials into small glasses of V8 Fusion and downed them. Mine had a pretty strong alcohol flavor but that was expected. 8:10 Phase 1 it begins.By 8:20 I’m feeling it pretty strong and that makes me happy. S is deep in visuals and laughing a lot making comments about hanging on and did you see that etc. and L and Q are also doing well. We sit down and watch the Salton Sea movie. Though an interesting movie and has its moments S calls the movie a downer and wants to shift gears. So we decide to head to the bar. We talked it over and the obvious choice was that S should drive since he was tripping the hardest and had poopoo’ed the movie (we were actually shocked he accepted but it made sense because it would give him some focus). Now don’t get your safety panties in a bunch it’s only about a mile down some back roads. 9:30 arrive at the bar.The first band was still packing up and so we were all standing around without anything to focus on. I turned to Q and said “the next band can’t start soon enough” feeling a little uneasy.  10:00 an eternity later.The band starts up and we breathed a sigh of relief. Vocals were heart felt the horn section was awesome really enjoyed it in our enhanced state. L was tired from working that day and bailed at 11:30 and took the car home. The band wrapped at 1:15 hung at bit talking with some other friends and then took a taxi home. I’m not sure if that driver will ever be the same.1:30 Phase 2 We are still had a decent trip going on so I started the psychedelic music mix with the visuals on the big screen and busted open the hippy crack (if you have ever done it you know why it’s called that). We each had a dispenser so no sharing was required and proceeded to blast the visuals and thoughts to the next level. There is nothing like cutting the mind loose on psychedelics.2:30 Phase 3The music mix finished and we were definitely coming down. Time for a refuel. We each did an additional 2 vials. As promised 15 minutes later we were feeling it. Decide it was time for Fear and Loathing. Still about a gross of whippits left so we settled in for some more fun.3:45 BedWell we did our duty and finished the whippits. We were still tripping but we were plum worn out.  Turned the movie off and went to bed and feel asleep after about 10 mins. Don’t remember any wild dreams but slept pretty good.The next day everyone was mellow and felt good. No after effects execpt for adjusted attitudes. ConclusionSo how do I rate the liquid shrooms? Convenient  very quick onset no stomach issues 4-6h duration lovely trip less edgy than acid. Everyone on this adventure had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend it for people who get off on a 1/8oz of shrooms or who don't like the chemical nature of acid. A great smooth trip that is still cheaper better healthier than a night out drinking.I need to try it again this time start with fewer vials and ramp up to see if perhaps less will get the job done. If not then the cost benefit is not good for me. I can do better with the acid (cheaper/longer and I like the edgy).Take care fellow trippersJackTheTab","psychedelics","869",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"727",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","10-15-14I tried ""mushrooms"" for the first time a few months ago both dried and Trip's liquid product.  Trip's product was much cleaner to ingest / digest / minimal stomach ache or cramps compared to the dried product.  I always get a natural body high from 1 bottle - meaning it's like taking a strong pain pill - my body relaxes and feels at ease.  About 30-60 minutes in you'll get some level of hallucinogenic effect depending on your tolerance height / weight and whether you have a full stomach or empty.  For me this is a safe and easy ""drug"" to use.  No harsh chemicals ingested no police field tests (you can just say it's a herbal or energy drink - they can't test it) no odor no sweating no dehydration no drowsiness no ""crazy"" trip ... just a mellow easy-going experience ... almost like taking a pain pill or two but with less of a zombie effect and more of a heightened awareness (e.g. colors become more bright and clear sounds are louder basically all you senses are heightened ... which is fun.   I'll keep coming back.  Give it a try.  Thanks   ","psychedelics","194",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This was SWIM's first time on shroomsSWIM took 1 vial at 4:20 PM SWIM was sitting in his car with his friend D.D was sober at the time and SWIM felt kinda bad that he wasn't tripping with me.SWIM and D chilled in SWIM's car for around 20 minutes didn't get any visuals yet but had a body high (I ate right before)SWIM thought it was fake at first since it was 20 minutes in and didn't see anything.At around 30 minutes the visuals started to kick in slowly SWIM noticed more detail in my house/D's face. (Lol)SWIM and D had to go to D's house to go get his tablet so he can kik his girl so SWIM went to his house.When SWIM arrived at his house there was kids everywhere screaming at me throwing cats on me everything giving SWIM a bad trip.So SWIM and D went outside for a bit and later met up with his dad. His dad said if we got him 5$ he'd get us some suboxone.So D gave his dad 5$ and we had to go on ride to dealers house to pick it up on the way back D took some suboxone (I didn't want to since I was tripping)While in the car I noticed how funky the cars looked they looked like plastic cars with huge ass wheels. SWIM was noticing tons of other visuals also.I had to keep quiet though because there was kids in the car still and I didn't want them to think SWIM was fucked up.Later on we got home and went to SWIM's weedman's house.Weedman was drunk af and rolled a 3 gram joint so me and D smoked some which enhanced the visuals.D finally felt the suboxone kick in and it knocked him on his ass we had to get the weedman to take us home.Once Weedman took D home SWIM decided to walk home. SWIM was walking home and noticed way more visuals than before. (This was like 3-4 hours later after taking it)It felt good and pretty good visuals wish I took more though.Visuals 4/5Shipping 5/5Customer Support: 6/5Overall it was a great trip worth the money.

"729",NA,"gfn product review thread (mdma lsd mda shrooms foxy and more?)","Firstly for all Canadian buyers taking advantage of my domestic discount/bulk MD(M)A rates I am pleased to inform you that I will be returning with drastically reduced pricing.  I am hoping most of the profit margin lost on each order will be nearly or entirely negated by a higher volume of domestic business and am willing to work my ass off to increase domestic product flow with a reduced profit margin.  If it works out the increased flow could help me leverage for better yet relationships with suppliers allowing for FURTHER price reductions down the road when production rates increase just to keep up with my rate of purchase.  If it doesn't work out and this just results in a substantial reduction of revenue for the same amount of work my prices will likely rise some.  Also these reduced profit margins (on MDMA and MDA) mean that I won't be giving as much extra weight as I used to - small orders that would often come 2-5g overweight with my old pricing will now be more like 1-3g overweight and large orders (of 100g or more) will likely only come a little overweight for good measure since my margins on those will now be modest enough that even typical BTC fluctuations will be much more of a concern for me.  Yes you may not be getting as much extra but we're talking about prices that have been reduced by hundreds for listings of 100g or more so you will still be getting a better deal.Second US listings have been reduced in price (and 30g is now the minimum amount for export instead of 60) but are still substantially more than my Canadian rates.  Export prices are what they are because of the much higher legal risk for export.  Not only do I want to make more for that risk but I want to pay the faces that have to drop it off in person at the post office generously for their services to my customers and I both - most of the price difference between my Canadian & American rates goes to these fine individuals.  Also I regretfully am no longer offering lettermail MD(M)A (3.5-14g) to the US as there have been about 10 reports of non-delivery (but no love letters or anything just claimed non-delivery).  Although I said I would take no responsibility for untracked lettermail orders I have given full refunds for every claim and the feedback on those listings was very positive but I've had an impeccable success rate over the last couple years exporting with tracking and tracking is preferable for obvious reasons even if it means putting a face on a camera to send it.  Any US buyers capable of receiving in Canada CHECK OUT MY DOMESTIC PRICES and you just might find it's worth receiving it in Canada and then sending it stateward yourself!  The savings are pretty substantial.  That all being said I just want to add that my tracked MD(M)A orders to the US will still include as much extra product as you're used to since the profit margins for these orders can comfortably afford it Lastly my personal activities packaging/storage facilities and internet usage locations are now much more separate than they previously were so I'll be bouncing back and forth from all three of these areas now.  This means I may only be able to do packing sessions once every 2-3 days and I may only get online every 2-3 days (as I'll be alternating between them and spending off-time elsewhere entirely) if I'm busy.  If I have time I'll try to do a bit of everything every day.  I will still send out rounds of orders at least once per week but probably 2 or more times per week.  Processing time is still 1-7 days but Canadian MD(M)A customers won't get ridiculously overweight shipments for the high end of that (but US customers will continue to for those higher rates they pay)oh yeah and in-house production is a serious goal for the first half of 2015 along with some menu additions (tryptamines & phenathylamines only so NO ketamine or similar dissociatives etc.)ps.  will get to my recent messages within the next 48 hours","psychedelics","704",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The package arrived within 5 days like anticipated. Stealth was good and product was well packaged.So after work I planned to drink the vial to myself and once again return to the wonderful world that psilocybin unlocks. Having seen it on SR and Trip With Science having such a high rating made me think about if liquid psilo would be bunk or not.Â  The nine hour day went by slower than usual because of my anticipation to try this stuff out.I drank the whole vial shortly after arriving home from work. I forgot to grab a bottle of orange juice which kind of sucked by how bad the stuff tastes. It was about 1am and everyone in the house was asleep and I was really excited but also a bit anxious as I usually do before going into such mindsets. I rolled two joints and decided to take one outside to wait for the trip to take effect. The weather is a little chilly in upper midwest this time of year and autumn is in full swing.Â  The come up was the usual feel of something becoming a little strange. Odd but subtle things would happen and would have me laugh for a second. There was no nausea or anything but I did have alot of anticipation for the trip before I reached the peak.All of a sudden while laying in my bedroom listening to some trance music and doing some relaxed breathing it hit. My body had that gummy feel and I just wanted to lay and stare at my ceiling lol. I would often migrate outside and smoke some weed and it made everything even more vivid.For this product claiming to be mild I would agree. But for about 1 hour it is really intense and a great experience overall. Psilocybin is my favorite drug and Trip With Science is doing a great job of supplying people with quality product.For begginers to the pychedelic world I would say this is a good start. To enthusiasts like myself this is a must try! I drank the potion at 1 am last night and it is now 6 am and still feeling aftereffects. Im going to be ordering more for sure and soon!Thanks Trip!Mahteen","psychedelics","389",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Shipping was great took a couple of days from when the order was placed. Stealth was great as well.Upon receiving the vial I did a little bit of reseaerch. I had a musical playlist that would make sure that I would not get in a bad mood. I also had a buddy who had never done shrooms before come over to make the experience more enjoyable. Who wants to trip alone? We made no plans for the night execpt to reach certain depths of our minds not experienced prior.The vial went down smooth. I only wish I had gotten some orange juice as most recommend. The first hour after I had taken the vial was the roughest. My mindset was not happy I was worried about something and that made me act irrational. My bud seemed alright even though I was balled up in the corner of my darkest thoughts. After the hour of feeling lost in my head I had a random friend come by and suggested we go to a pub to experience the full capability of the trip. We agreed. The lights were amazing when I got into the car and being arpound people definately helped me get out of my head. Even the voices of the local drunks fused together made the experience more enjoyable.Â  Overall I am definately happy I experienced what I did.

It gives you the eyes of a young baby who continually is filled with marvel. I've used these liquid shrooms a few times now. I'm on the go but I still like to do my drugs so this is a perfect one to take anywhere. Seriously. If you have a pair of sunglasses you can trip anywhere my friends. Anyway!!!!!!Ok let me tell you about one of my trips. My friend and I just went out on the town the night before being the young good-looking (wannabe) players that we are. We got smashed and were way hung over. But today was our day off and I wanted to do something excellent. So I pulled out 3 vials of this liquid mushroom magic and we got in my 4runner and headed up to the nearest scenic location that we could chill at for a few hours. We went to a nice little wooded area surrounded by little chipmunks and squirrels and birds the floor was covered in dried pine needles.. basically it was a pretty dank spot. So I said to my friend feeling sick and shitty from the partying the night before ""let's do dis."" Anyway I drank 2 he drank 1. It took approximately 10 minutes for me to feel this euphoric grasp of existance as a living being on this unique little planet. I started witnessing the beauty and contrast of everything that nature made up this reality that I was experiencing. It was not real it felt like I was in a virtual reality game literally. Anyway colors were brighter than ever my love for the world and my friend that I was with was felt my senses were all so in tune... IT WAS AWESOME! As the effects started wearing off about 5 hours later I started to drive back. . wait. NOPE! I was way too shroomy. So we ended up going slow until we found the first place we could stop which was a lodge that had a little bar in it. We stopped went in had a blueberry ale beer talked with this nice couple passing thru gave the bartender the hugest tip of her life and left.BASICALLY. FUCK.

Here is a little trip report for you guys T-00: Dropped 3/4 of a Tab (so approx. 150ish give or take) Gave friend the remaining tab and a quarter. Put on Bo Burnam ""What.""T-15: Something is different. Lights are a little funny definitely not sober surprising but not completely unexpected. T-30: Body is suddenly heavy. Feeling almost couchlocked. Have almost no energy at all. Start meditating to calm my nerves. (I was very anxious and nervous at this point having never done it before but knowing generally what to expect!)T-45: Definitely feeling it at this point getting slightly into the headspace but not too intensely yet. Having some deep thoughts. Body is still heavy. Bo Burnham ""What."" is nearing the end. T-1;00: I realize that I'm definitely tripping. I decide that I want to go to the park nearby. Getting some slight visuals not really noticing them however. Start the walk to the park.T-1;30: We start watching ducks in a little pond. One of them looks like a little grandma duck. I suddenly have lots of energy and can't stop smiling. We sit on a bench and start looking at the clouds. They're suddenly dancing back and forth as they move along the sky. Almost waving hello. (This was my favorite part of the whole trip) we sit outside and wave back to the clouds big grins plastered on our faces. We spend a couple hours just relaxing in the park.T-2;15: It's getting warm outside so we decide its time to head back to the house for a bit. We head back and the headspace starts to engulf me. I'm in my own little world but it's a nice world and I'm enjoying it there.T-2;45: We arrive back home Excited to get a drink of water and color! We gulp some water down pull out the paper and colored pencils and we go to town. I started with scribbles they started to swirl and pull themselves into what they wanted to be. Almost as if the lines were telling me where they wanted to be. A face sticking his tongue out. I gently placed a rainbow colored square on his tongue and labled it ""Self portrait"" T-4;00: I realize just how long I was coloring. Time went by so fast I didnt even notice. Now time is starting to melt together. Bathroom trips themselves are intense. I get lost in the mirror easily (although not unpleasantly) and my face begins to twist and turn and move and smile of its own free will. Somethings off but I can't figure out what. Our babysitter goes through the physical needs checklist and realizes that we are hungry. I'm skeptical but they drive us to get some pizza. After bringing back a few slices to the car we realize that's what we wanted all along! The pizza was delicious. I'd never tasted something quite like it. Even though I'd had the pizza before it was as if I was experiencing it all over again. T-5;00: We head back to the house after a short little drive around town. We sit down and listen to music and contemplete personal issues.T-7;00: We head back out to the park enjoy the sunset and relax on the benches.T-8;00: We go get some ice cream from an ice cream shop. This was the only uncomfortable part for me. The entire night seriousness had been bordering on hilarity. I almost burst out laughing in the shop. Thankfully there were only a few others there. The ice cream was delicious. T-8;30: We get back to the house. Visuals are nearly gone. It's still fairly early though so we decide to smoke a little cannabis to go a little further into the headspace. We smoke and suddenly I'm gone. T-9;00: Everything after this point is a blur. Every thought was profound. I can't help but laugh at every little thing. We stay up for another 2 hours or so and then I head up to bed. I take a 3mg melatonin and as I close my eyes I'm met with fractals for the first time  Primsms of colors and shapes so wild I couldnt contain my excitement. I doze off to sleep somehow and wake up feeling refreshed albeit tired from the previous day.One thing to note is that the body load was significant the entire time. I didn't think it would be that intense. Definitely something to prepare myself for next time. I had some jaw clenching (which i get normally when uncomfortable) and my muscles wouldnt relax unless i forced myself to calm down. Overall the experience was amazing and I can't wait to do it again sometime  Thanks Tess for making it possible for me to have this experience!Edit; Forgot to add that a few times my trip almost got scary and then I realized I was in control!

Folks? Mods? )Ordered 2.5g MDMA. Shipment arrived quickly with the LSD I've posted about.After I've had a very good experience with their LSD I tried the MDMA.First I used ""EZ Test for Ecstasy"" Marquis reagent to test it. I also tasted the product before it and the taste was tipical MDMA bitterness.The test came up NEGATIVE! I was baffled. I refused to believe that what I got is not only not MDMA but it does not react at all. It couldn't be  I tried to test a proven batch from a different vendor AND THAT TOO WAS BLANK. It did not react to sugar either.  Ahh! The test was WRONG!After some experimenting it turned out that the test was probably stored for too long or incorrectly (or both).I ordered two more tests but all came up negative. All tests from the same source were lying.I did some paper chromatography on the product and the other batch. All evidence was pointing towards that lsdaisy's product is INDEED MDMA.I was careful and firs tried a small amount about 10mg and did not feel much of course.Next day I prepared 100mg of the MDMA in drinking water. I swallowed the first half at T0 ~= 14:00.  The aftertaste of the MDMA water was slightly like anise (bingo  ).The stuff started to came in around 14:20-14:40 and a very typical MDMA rush started to began. After 15:00 I started to roll DEFINITELY.  I swallowed the other half which started to kick in gradually and around 16:00 I was amazed.Thank you lsdaisy and fuck those who sell shit tests.

First of all the quality of the trip was brilliant it was retrospective and I was deeply entertained. I kept getting strong bursts of happiness and ecstacy almost as if I was rolling and tripping at the same time. The colors were extraordinarily vibrant and it almost became geometric with some of the dark shadows. Grade A fantastic shrooms. I would definitely recommend more for sure and am currently making another order. Wonderful stealth vacuume sealed packaging and quick delivery from the other side of the states. All around best trip I ever had just on one vial anymore than one isnt neccessary unless youre looking for a really fun and trippy time. The liquid form also eliminates the nausea and upset stomach completely. Me nor my friend who took the liquid shrooms experienced any displeasure during the whole affair. The onset was very fast especially if taken on an empty stomach. The quick onset didnt take away from the length of the trip. I was notably still tripping 4-5 hours later and did not have and negative after effect. The trip was also very benificial in the sence of my mental state afterwards. Very refreshing and rewarding.

I'm an every day dank smoker as long as I have some and I've done LSD and 2-cb over 15 times a piece actual shrooms around 20 times molly many.. many times and a mescaline analogue once which I think was Allylescaline. Overall I've had a few bad trips but most of the time it's been smooth sailing when I consume psychedelics. Okay on to the trip... So at around 6:30 last night I decided I wanted to test out Trip's product as I had one vial on hand and about a gram of some good kush. First thing as always with my trips I took a nice bowl rip of my bud to get in the mindset and then prepared the product. I filled a shot glass about half way with some fruit punch and mixed with half of the vial down the hatch and I put on Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas for the come-up as is my usual routine. About 10-20 minutes later I began to feel the first alerts not much in the visual sense just started to feel different. At about 45 minutes in I looked around and began to notice that my ceiling and carpet was morphing around a bitÂ  and decided to take another couple hits from my bowl which increased the visuals from slight morphing to steady morphing in different directions and my walls began to breathe and stretch. So at this point I was feeling pretty good CEV's became apparent but were not very strong a very nice and relaxing body high without any nausea or stomach pain had me feeling the ""oneness"" I usually experience on shrooms or LSD. At around an hour or so into the trip I decided that the current feeling was nice but not enough for my tastes so I mixed the rest of the vial into the shot glass again and packed up some more trees. About 20 minutes later I was ""there"" as I like to call it lol In a complete psychedelic state I went downstairs to have a cigarette and the big popcorn ceiling down there was morphing like crazy with colors from one end to the other that looked like the sky when the sun it setting. Absolutely beautiful I was mesmerized staring at it. Later on in the night around 11 I still had slight OEV's but when I closed my eyes the CEV's were pretty intense tessellations and fractals morphing into each other and creating other designs. Overall I have to say this is an outstanding product and I'll definitely be ordering more although next time I'll take a full vial at once since the half wasn't enough for me. I'm happy that I tried this product and thank you VERY much for what you do Trip your product provided one of the more clean and pure trips that I've come across.Much respect to you brotha-piff","psychedelics","549",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Once for Shiva Jesus hits + 1 gram 2CBSecond order was for 50 hits of beatles 100ug berkley silver.My first transaction was perfect. A week to my door. Stealth was perfect and kindof awesome.The 2CB was REALLY amazing I have ordered it a few times from other vendors. This was on point. Many friends are waiting for me to restock The second order came again in a week. The stealth literally made me laugh reeally really awesome stealth! Though the order was for 5 of her beatles berkley silver 100ug x10 listings. I only received 10.Anyways I tolder her I only got 10 of the 50 hits. She responded after an hour saying she will send another 50! woop!  I am hoping they arrive this week I will update when they land.BTW I ate one of the 100ug beatles. And it was an amazing first LSD experience. Truly amazing. Mushrooms always made me feel TOO strange and out of touch with reality. I geared towards bad trips...but with this acid.. It was just fun and I explored the universe in my head. And I feel like I really learned alot about myself. I also decided and made goals on how to start improving myself.Lastly when she comes back from vacation mode I am getting more berkley silver tabs and trying her MDMA. So I will update my thoughts on her MDMA (MDMA is the one drug I know way too much about)TL","265",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"738",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Hey EveryoneLet me start by saying I am 25 years old. During my short time on mother Earth I have tripped on nearly all ""Tripping"" drugs there are.  Some examples are mushrooms acid DMT 4-ACO 5-MEO exc. exc. I have experienced both the most beautiful positive  life altering experiences; and the most terrifying negative life altering experiences. I have experienced through DMT what my subconscious perceives as consciousness Heaven Hell the Soul and God. I have mentally 'snapped' only on liquid acid thus far to the point were I was unable to remember my own name and pretty much my entire life.  All in all I have learned many concepts and acquired much knowledge through all of my psychedelic experiences. Thus I am thankful and happy for all of my life experiences whether I perceived them as 'good' or 'bad'. Having said all that about three weeks ago I was searching for acid and accidentally came across Trip's Liquid Mushrooms. I immediately needed to know if this is what I thought it was so I clicked on the page. After reading the entire page my thoughts were ""Holy shit YES! Finally a way to do mushrooms without the digestion and nausea!"" I purchased three two days later they arrived. Yesterday my friend and I said cheers popped off the tip touched vials and downed the hatch. I am an honest man so trust me when I say that the effects were almost immediate. This makes sense of coarse because there is no digestion process. Within 20 minutes I was already feeling immense euphoria. Within an hour I was already peaking without any intense come up. After smoking some bud my friend and I decided to walk to the park. We sat down on a patch of land surrounded by trees our little chill spot. At this point I experienced the most beautiful visuals that I have ever experienced from mushrooms. We talked and talked smiled laughed ran and ate. The entire trip lasted for about 6 hours after which I felt rejuvenated. Not just my mind but my body as well! I felt like a new person. My friend and I both agreed that after experiencing Trip's Liquid Mushrooms we would never go back to regular mushrooms again. THANK YOU TRIP!","psychedelics","381",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I had iTunes playing in the background and I thought it would be cool to turn the visualizer on.  It was.  The next forty-five minutes were some of the best I've ever spent on a shroom trip.  I'll definitely order more than one vial for the next trip.  Three thumbs up Trip.  You are a demigod my friend.","psychedelics","169",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

My body is super warm and comforting. One of the best feeling ever. The visuals were really cool. I felt like my walls were really tall and I was just a little baby laying in my bed in this huge world. My lights were off so I wasn't able to see many open eye visuals but closed eye visuals were amazing every song that came on had it's own little music video in my head but extremely trippy and psychedelic.

"743",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","First off delivery was quick and stealth was awesome. I waited til night time with lots of stars in the sky and tripped outside this is my prefered way to trip. I purchased 4 vials and downed all of them back to back. There were coyotes back in the woods and they started howling as soon as i began downing the vials I was like damn I hope this doesn't give me a bad trip thankfully it didn't I was used to them anyway and just laughed it off and took the rest of the vials. As with many high dose trips words don't do it justice but I will try. It kicked in after 10-15 minutes and the flowing pulsating geometrical patterns were infinitely complex it was amazing. I was looking out across a fieldÂ  with big round bails of hay and I was just sitting in a chair at this time i saw everything from little ghost like things running around everywhere there was also a street light that became like an alter and all the little ghosts or spirits started running up to it along with cobras. afterwards the street light became a lantern adn the trees surrounding it became a japanese pagoda. Afterwards the hay bails became like ancient war ships being rowed across the sea. the symbolism being projected from my unconscious was amazing and impssible to describe fully I saw many differen ancient scenes. I was also able to come to terms with some personal situations going on in my life throughout the trip as well. After awhile i got out of the chair to explore my yard. At one point a big semi truck went by and the trailer was a dinosaur and I thought this was absolutely hilarious. I went by a motion light on a shed in my yard and once it came on all of the leaves on the ground became a vast herd ofÂ  mini dinosaurs as if I were looking at them from way up in the sky. I also remember walking up to a small tree I had hacked down with a machete a few days prior and i actually saw a very distinct blue line going up the tree which represented where the water and nutrients flow through the trunk and all the branches I suddenly felt bad for cutting it down and apologized to the tree and also thanked it for providing wood for a bonfire we had with it with friends and family and then I telepathaically got the message that I was forgiven and that the tree was happy it was able to give me and my fam a good time. These were the main highlights to go into furthere detail would be overkill as well as hard to put into words but overall a very good and well needed trip thanks tws will definitely be a repeat buyer at some point.","psychedelics","489",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I downed it with a tiny glass of orange juice and starting experiencing some nausea(this is my first time and probably why). My body was definitely fighting it and I was beginning to feel anxious not feeling anything for the first hour. It was definitely blocking the effects for me because I was seeing the hue of my room changing and having some deep thoughts. 90 minutes in I was still nausueas and now getting weirdly impatient and somewhat upset so I grabbed my ice bong and fired up my best weed. BAM! everything fixed after a 10 minute bong session! I was feeling great my nausea went away and I was thoroughly relaxed. I finished off with a very relaxed trip. I felt confident and chill about the state of world and the state of being in and of itself if that makes any sense lol. It was a great unattachment that I strive for in my everyday life.

Thanks TESS!!!so me and a friend decide to dose and then walk to his place 1/4 mile or so from where I live.It is Sunday October 22014.Beautiful sunnycoldwindy fall day.T-00 My friend dropped his tabsthree of House of Spirits ganeshas around 8:30am. We start walking towards his place.T-45 We are at my friends apt my friend is overwhelmed with euphorialaughing hysterically and staggered can barely walk as we go into his                apartment complex.  Somehow I manage to steer him to his apt room and convince him that this is his place and he has keys. He is literallylike a small child at this point...lost in his Willy Wonka World. It's quite awesome to witness this. T-1:00 my friend is puddled on the floor giggling and talking about energy gridsTom and Jerry Joe Rogan podcasts numbers all over and how everything is swirlingwhile he points and  ""paints"" in the air with his fingers. I seriously have no clue how any of those things relate but it is funny as fuck and I start laughing hard too.  He is out there but we are safe in his apartment and all is cool. T-1:30 I drop two of Tess' tabs. My friend is sitting cross-legged on the floor playing with an ipodgrinning. We talk abit- he's tripping really hard but can hold a conversation- but he can't seem to remember what he is saying and his thoughtflows just switch from one thing to the next.T-2:00 It all comes on me...warm and energetic. I feel abit shaky and start giggling. T-2:30 I'm feeling abit tense in my chest area and I stand up and stretch. My whole body is buzzing all over. My friend says the same- that he feels like he's in a massage chair. T-3:00 We are both just laughing at everything. I feel amazing! It's soooooooooooooo clean and wonderful. Everthing is just rainbows and the air is just flowing cascades of sultrymelting colors and patterns are all over the place.I will admitI was not quite as 'floored' with that physical ""I can't fucking move I'm so stunned"" euphoria as I was in the past with 400ug of Tess. But I've also been eating allot of acid this summerso tolerance and just a general familiarity with LSD plays a part there I'm sure...but it was def VERY euphoric and I was laughing allot. Certainly felt like 400ug energy-wise. The duration fit too. T-3:15 We head out into the lobby making our way outside. My friend skips through the hallway like a gazelle and is so happyas am I.We both note how ornate and beautiful the carpeting is- helixsand spirallingcoiled symetrical patterns in lavender and green.T-4:00 We are outside in a smoking pit looking out over a river and EVERYTHING IS AMAZING.The clouds are layered and moving into eachother and making movies for us. We both create stories and play them out as they appear in the sky and in the water. My friend says the water looks like huge waves...that it looks like an ocean in a storm. It is quite windyso the water is moving fiercely.T-4:30 fractalizations all over. I see a face in the clouds...repeating out into infinity...and then meeting other fractal faces and scenes that merge to form a larger more complex fractal. I used fractals before in my descriptions but I think these were my first REAL fractal views of this depth and density.T-5:00 to 6:00 I'm just amazed at how much energy I have. It's pulsing all over. We walk all over then sit under  a stone wall next to a stream.We stare at the suneyes closed...then open them...repeat. It's amazing...such brilliant color forms exploding all over. Truly of a kaliedoscopic nature.T-6:30 I go back home.For the next few hours I lay down on a couch and am completely absorbed in the most amazing cevs. This is the best part of the tripreally...just in my head and this inner space...not much I could explain here. Just a deep journey withinthoughts racing wildy- movies and patterns just crashing into me and around me...I'm in an ocean of visual and sensory bliss for a long time until...T-9:00 my friend calls and wants to meet up again. I really just wanna be alone but I oblige.We end up in the back of a bar sipping on somebeers listening to tunes. It turns out to be a nice time. We are both vibing nice and we talk about life stuff and it's great to flesh things out.There's plenty of laughs and aside from police scoping us out and scouring the back area ( we are in a outside back patio area of a bar and it is empty besided us) - we had kept good cheer.T-11:00 my friend goes homehugs and all...he wants to simmer down for the night.   I stay at the bar and order wings. They were so good. Football game was fun. Pitsburgh is destroying Cleveland everything is funny.   OEVs are pretty much gone except some mild tracers.T-13:00 so it's like 11-12am now I suppose. I crash. As I dose off I am greeted by some still amazing cevs...and I softly nod off into this amazing vivid dreamscape. Aside from getting up a few times thoughout the night for water and bathroom I get good rest.Today I feel awesome. So awesome. My friend calls and says the same. Today we are hiking somewhere. I love LSD. But what I love even more is how alive and happy I feel the days after.Thanks so much Tess! A++Really amazing stuff you provide. Will come back again.I usually don't order from Tess now due to having closerdomestic options with faster arrival.But this acid he provides is very special and has it's own characterworthy ofrevisiting from time to time.

We each took 2 vials at the same time mixed into orange juice. I was surprised that while the vials initially smelled like ethanol on the outside when I opened them they were odorless and had no taste once mixed. It was exactly like drinking normal OJ.As far as the trip itself within about 15 to 25 minutes all of us were starting to feel the effects. It hit me at about the 15 minute mark myself. I can only guess that it comes on so fast and so strong because it's a liquid while solid caps and stems take a little while to digest. Having done mushrooms on numerous occasions the come-up felt familiarly like the normal onset of shrooms -- only faster. The experience itself was great. We all felt very loose and had that nice serotonin buzz.

"753","**vendor review****tessellatedlsd**","I've been with Tessellated since the first Silk Road he's the first vendor that I bought LSD from and will most certainly be my last. There is no reason to go to another vendor. Period. This can be summed up and explained for the following reasons:Stealth 6/5: The stealth is truly next-gen and really out-of-this-world creative. He’s had the same stealth since my first order on SR and there’s no reason to change it. It’s the best possible stealth for small tabs no doubt.Product 7/5: Don’t even get me started. My friends from Vancouver rage about this stuff as being some of the best they’ve had and it’s made right across the pond from them! I’ve taken two 100ug tabs before from somewhere else and it’s just not the same as taking one tab from tessellated. The only explanation I have for this is the purity of tes’s tabs. Not only are his tabs actually 200ug but something that’s even more notable than the strength is the potency and clarity of this acid. Anyone can take a ten stip of LSD and be relatively fine...IF it’s good acid. If it’s not good extremely clean acid then there’s a huge chance of there being problems during the trip (bad trip black out etc…). I have personally taken 1200ug of this acid and was able to talk to my friend while peaking. Not many other tabs can achieve such clarity at high levels. It’s more expensive than most but hey remember what prices were like for LSD on SR1? This guy’s current prices back then would have made him the lowest on the site.Communication ?/5: I’ve never had the pleasure of sending a message to this vendor as all my order have always came in on time although i’m sure he’s prompt.TL","330",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Well it's funny my very first experience with the silver was so visual...never had visuals like it before on any cid. Mandala like geometrical morphing on sidewalks I recall...like just crazy. And that was on the gummies laid with 245ug of silver.The last time I had czech back in Sep it was not the same geometrical morphing but the more typical visuals I get- forms of numbers and letters flowing in the air patterning. But they were still awesome! I mean 300ug of the siver had me buzzin for 12 hrs and was very visual.But the House tabs have been also consistently amazing as well. Please don't take insult here but I think many of us have had allot of acid this summer. It's quite possible that there is a overall tolerance build up- even with breaks in between. I have noticed that I have to take about 350-400ug now to get the same type of trips I used to get on 200ug...and that's even with 14 day  breaks. Back in June of '13 400ug had me stuck to a chair during the comeup  and during the peaks I would have lots of intense synethesiaaudio warping smells from nowhereetc.  I'd have to eat a 10 strip now to get that mindfuked. The trips are still magical but they don't have that 'shock and awe' or disorientating  factor they did last year. The LSD induced psychedelic space has become a familiar place. So now when we dose- we come to EXPECT things rather than just LETTING IT ALL HAPPEN.  I'm pretty sure if we all stopped tripping for the winter and came back in May 400ug would floor any of us.","psychedelics","282",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"756",NA,"retirement announcement*~sunwu feedback thread~~ lsd specific review"," Just wanted to say I  received my raw xtal today !  A bittersweet moment for sure","so elated to have been able to purhase crystal lsd but so sad that its my final order from sunwu.    Thanks again sw for all you have done here. Not just for me but for everyone.  You have been a shining example of what this movement is all about. Being able to safely and securely purchase some of the purest drugs around.  You have always been extremely professional during the buying process but also very helpful before and after the purchase.  It may not seem like.much to some but to me it does to know that a vendor is more than just knowledgable about the products they are selling.  This is an anonymous drug trade and frankly anyone could be here selling god knows what.  Having the piece of mind that purchasing from sw meant purchasing from the source.  Although you guys are retiring you will not be forgotten..  wish you all the best!","psychedelics",171,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"757",NA,"top_gear_uk lsd review thread","Just realised that we had to leave a review here as opposed to on the actual seller page I've already brought two tenstrips of 115mics.The first 'lsd experience' I had im pretty sure I was sold something else so when I dropped two tabs of TGUK's stuff I was surprised when the whole trip had some differrent effects as well as lasting much longer","two tabs was enough to send me loooopy as fuck for a good 10 hours+.The other ten strip I ended up giving to a friend and he loved it to!About to order my third tenstrip before maybe moving onto bigger amounts in regards to stealth and delivery times for me its all top notch I suppose at the end of the day any delays experienced are just as much (if not more) down to the royal mail as one of mine arrived 4 days after and the other was next day.Anyway cheers TGUK!Â ","psychedelics",157,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"758",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","First off - this is my first post on the forums I've used SR2 several times but never posted before. Apologies if I mess anything up.Trip is an absolutely AMAZING vendor probably the best I've ever dealt with on the road. He has incredibly fast turnaround sent a very long and helpful message upon receiving my order with details about how Silk Road works and trip safety and takes his stealth seriously (I laughed out loud when I got the package very clever). Just in general a stand-up guy.Moving on to the product itself. I'm a male pretty thin (140ish pounds) currently taking precription SSRIs/anxiety medication so I expected the trip to be dulled a little bit and I have experience with LSD which I didn't particularly enjoy. I spent my trip talking to my friend through Skype as I unfortunately couldn't be with him in person.I drank one vial at 8:40 pm. The effects took about an hour to start really hitting me and lasted probably around 6 hours (there was probably a bit more but at that point I was tired enough that I wasn't really noticing them much). I didn't experience many ""trippy"" effects most likely because the medication dulled the experience but mentally they were extremely enjoyable. I was very talkative and happy and everything just seemed brighter and more positive. It's hard to really explain the experience... but it was very very worth it for what I paid. Getting more soon and looking forward to trying a larger dose!","psychedelics","254",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"759",NA,"tripwithscience – liquid mushroom (pure psilocybin) vendor review thread","Trip Report For TripAge: 19Weight: 123lb’s Dose: One vial (well more like 5/6’s a little leaked in transit oh well. Recovered some other vial shipped was fine.)Setting: Mostly my room alone most of the time and interacting with others the rest of the time.Prolog: First I just like to say Trip’s a really awesome vendor and I wish everyone on the markets were as equally awesome. He was very helpful and informative with a quick response time I would also like to say that he has a really lovely product that he’s clearly taken the time in crafting and also has pretty great stealth.Now to the report I was really excited when Trips package arrived so much so that I could resist taking one of the two vials that night mixing it with some blueberry pomegranate juice before doing so feeling ecstatic at the time to see what shrooms would be like never having done them before but having a fair amount of experience with LSD (and various other things) I was hypothesizing and hoping a bit haha that they would be similar to LSD but also different in their own unique way. (Essentially that it would be as awesome but also a new experience it was) I had acquired shrooms once before but upon realizing that they tasted horrible and also not thinking at the time to make a powder and create a drink from that I just gave them to someone else anyway after taking the vial and waiting to come up I went to go talk with my sister a bit about our lives and various aspects of them. After a while of talking to her I started to feel the effects at first just in my mood and body a bit then mild visuals it was around this time I bid her good night and retreated to my room where I started craving human interaction again similar to the feeling I often experience on LSD where I get very talkative laugh a lot and have a pleasant manic feeling. So I started talking to someone over Skype for a while feeling genrally wonderful and having a grand time it was also around this time that time it self seemed much slower so when 18 mins would pass that would feel like an hour and I would look at the time often and think huh only 7 mins have passed well awesome. And that was awesome when you’re having an amazing experience and time slows down seeming to stretch on to forever alas they had to go after an hour or two. This was a good thing though because now I could freely ignore my computer and just be by myself and explore. Looking around the dimmed room I looked up at the art on the walls (various wolves and other anthromophised animals) taking a set back I saw again the reason I had chosen each of them and then looking just at the wall in general I understood what people mean when they say the walls were breathing. I then went to wander around and found a nice tile pattern to stare at eventually seeing a sort of vortex the kind that people show a talk about when the comparing time to being a fabric and how things like black holes are like placing a heavy object on that fabric. Anyway I wandered around saw lots of other stuff not all of it notable kinda wishing it was raining then I went back to my room once again and tried listening to music a bit but felt that I wasn’t enjoying it so I chose to listen to the sound of the steam and wind chimes outside laying in bed looking out the window trying to relax a bit but with the body high and my current mood it was hard so I smoked a little weed and stared out the window watching the colors of the little light that steamed in change and also just closing my eyes and focusing on my breathing started to imagine lots of things the type of thing where you go around pleasantly imagining whatever imagines and concepts are to your liking and forget many of them. Quite a bit of time had passed by now I had deffenilty started to come down past the peak a while ago I settled in some more relaxed reflected on my life and this experience maybe went on the computer again and watched something I’m not sure then I went to sleep (After a while of laying there). Something I took away from this was the feeling that on shrooms you can kinda take the experience and mood however you want to go or in a multiplicity of directions. Anyway it was awesome this description doesn’t do it justice and I can wait to try it again.TLDR- was awesome can’t wait to try it in a different setting and on a higher dose in the future would highly recommend Thanks again Trip!","psychedelics","839",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
